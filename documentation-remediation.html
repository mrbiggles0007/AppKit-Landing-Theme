            <h1 class="section-title">Documentation Remediation Projects For Managed Service Providers</h1>
            <p class="intro">Investing in a documentation overhall for your MSP is a excercise that requires a certain scale of business before clear benefits are realized.</p>			
<p>Our experience has proven that investing in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">documentation overhaul</a> for your MSP is an exercise that requires a certain <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">scale of business</a> before there are clear benefits with going ahead with the project.</p>
<p>While there are certainly exceptions depending on how your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">MSP is built</a>, we have found that companies of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">less than 5 technical staff</a> are still growing their own <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for it infrastructure">processes and procedures</a>.</p>
<p>They are often run by the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">owner</a> who has a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">strong view</a> on how things should be set up. In other words, sometimes <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">business owners</a> need to take a few years seeing what does not work to see the value in what we provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">Economies of scale</a> make a big difference with a documentation project. Once a business is north of 5 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">technical staff</a>, they often have a clear path, have been struggling with a documentation system that has had <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">relatively little planning</a> put into it and are at a point they know there are issues and understand <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">changes need to be made</a>.</p>
<p>Companies above 5 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">technical support staff</a> are easier to work with, have a clear <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">understanding</a> of what they are trying to achieve &amp; understand that a company like ours has seen the same issues over and over again &amp; are likely best positioned to give guidance with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">highest likelihood of success</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Improvements Your MSP Can Expect</h2>
<p>We will use the example of implementing a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">universal onboarding</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">offboarding framework</a> for all of your clients, this is a common task that often results in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">significant efficiency improvements</a>.</p>
<p>Above 5 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">technical staff</a>, every <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">small improvement</a> clocks up impressive time savings because of the critical mass of staff that are exposed to the improvements.</p>
<p>We are not magicians, we are more like janitors that will come in and do the work that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">your own staff</a> are too busy to do &amp; likely do not get much satisfaction from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put in the simplest terms, we <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">implement consistency</a> in your organization in such a way that by completion, you can hire <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">less experienced staff</a> to undertake positions previously that were held by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">more experienced staff</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">Poor documentation</a> is overcome by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">hiring staff</a> that have done whatever task is in front of them, that many times that they do not really need to rely on documentation. They will get there in the end.</p>
<p>The problem then gets compounded because it is normally these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">support staff</a> that are asked to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">create a document</a> on a procedure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have too little time and have a different idea of what constitutes <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/microsoft-teams-integration">good documentation</a> when compared to all other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">technicians</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a certainty that if you have 15 technicians then you will have 45 opinions on how documentation should be undertaken depending on the time of day and numerous other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">variables</a>.</p>
<p>This results in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">MSP documentation</a> that is often not even of use to the person that wrote it. Most companies do <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">invest time in documentation</a> however the consistency and quality is of such a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">poor standard</a> that nobody trusts it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People will not use documentation they do not trust and so the new guy that just started who is committed to not look dumb in front of his new workmates will attempt to use the documentation for a specific task which is often confusing and written by someone with much more experience that has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">left out numerous important steps</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will spend hours of their time trying to solve the problems before giving up and contacting one of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">senior techs</a> to ask a question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This wastes 2 peoples time &amp; often causes frustration with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">senior techs</a> as they are often under quite a bit of pressure &amp; have to drop everything to try and help the new guy out.</p>
<p>It causes stress in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">new hires</a>, frustration in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">experienced staff</a> &amp; is something that can be eliminated by seeking our help to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">standardize your documentation</a> and make it a time saving resource instead of a hindrance.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">How We Solve Your Documentation Problems</h2>
<p>We implement <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">consistency, standardization</a> backed up with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">staff training</a> driven off the back of your Documentation platform such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT Glue</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">Hudu</a>.</p>
<p>We make sure all documents, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">passwords</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">flexible assets</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">configurations</a> adhere to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">naming convention</a> so it is identical across all clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We separate <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">client specific information</a> from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for it infrastructure">general instruction guides</a> so that a new guide does not need to be written for every single client. We break up common segments of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/benefits of using chatgpt for technical documentation in managed services">how to guide</a> into blocks that can be bolted into any new or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/diagram-standardization">existing clients document</a>.</p>
<p>We train <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">existing and new staff</a> through <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">one on one training</a>, knowledgebase documents and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">video training</a> how to create useful documentation that adheres to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">agreed upon standard</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We implement a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">workflow rule</a> that allows us to check any new or updated documents and ensure they meet the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">minimum standard</a>. If there are issues we will follow up with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">help desk staff</a> after having remedied the oversights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best practice is to have them rectify the issues however sometimes the best way forward is to obtain the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">missing information</a> &amp; we <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">update the document</a>.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">onboarding</a> as an example here, say 5 of your clients use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">Skype</a> or a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">3rd party signature application</a>. We write a template once that applies to any existing client or new client that needs to have one of these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">common applications setup</a>. We copy the block into the clients <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">onboarding documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This prevents the infinite loop of continually writing the same documentation 50 different ways each time a new client comes on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">structure the documentation</a> so that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">folder structure</a> is identical across all clients. Every client will have an Active directory user setup section within their onboarding documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clients that do not use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">Active directory authentication</a> will just have an index entry that is not hyperlinked to the steps for this process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is important because it does several important things, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">new staff</a> will have a clear and consistent experience across all clients, the menu system will be identical and so they will become comfortable with it.</p>
<p>By having the menu item there keeping it consistent while also having it unlinked, it tells the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">new staff member</a> that someone has considered this process and it is not required.</p>
<p>When you are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">new to an organization</a>, it is very easy to become <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">unsure of the information</a> in front of you. Having the ability to quickly know that this section is not relevant for this client is much more effective than not having the section listed at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because it introduces uncertainty, did someone just forget to write a guide for it? Were they too busy? Should I ask someone? We often have landing pages in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT-Glue</a> that tell <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff</a> if they click on a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">flexible asset</a> that "<em>This subsystem eg: </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware"><em>VOIP</em></a><em> is not part of the managed service agreement - do not start work on any </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware"><em>VOIP tickets</em></a><em> for this client</em>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Telling staff <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">what your MSP does not do</a> is just as important as how to do the tasks that are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/monitoring backups for non agreement clients">part of an agreement</a>. Many hours to this day are lost by organizations spending hours on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">help desk service tickets</a> and services the client does not actually pay for.<br /><br /></p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Documentation Remediation Pricing Guidelines</h2>
            <div class="intro">This is a very rough estimate as no two MSPs are the same.</div> 	
<p>We like to give a guide on approximately what the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">initial cost</a> is. Remembering that often the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">existing systems</a> have been in place for sometimes decades and there are thousands of documents and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">passwords</a> to work through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This figure would be a guideline on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">initial investment</a> &amp; depends on how much you want to rectify. Most companies will engage us using a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">block time arrangement</a> as this gives everyone time to become comfortable working with us and to develop a level of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">trust</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will always give a list of tasks that we can complete with the agreed to number of hours so if you decide at the end to continue <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">in house</a> or take a different path, the investment will not have been wasted.</p>
<p>Each estimate builds on the one to the left so the 300 hour block would include tasks listed on the 100 hour block yet because of the economies of scale and the efficiency scale brings, more tasks can be undertaken for a given dollar value.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Coupled with a slight discount for the purchase of higher block amounts &amp; the value increases as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">number of staff increases</a>.</p>
