            <h1 class="section-title">Standard Operating Procedures</h1>
            <p class="intro">Legal & Industry Standard Status</p>
<p>Our Standard Operating Procedures are not legal documents. We have a set of templates that we have developed over many years that are designed to assist MSPs in recording their organizational knowledge into a format that ensures 
consistency and effectiveness in transferring that knowledge to staff in an easy to understand manner. If your SOPs are required to be legally binding or need to adhere to specific industry standards then we can work with the specialist organizations
that can produce a product at that level however we do not offer that level of service at this point.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">How do SOPs And KBs differ from each other?</h2>
<p>I wrote an article on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">5 main differences between a SOP and KB</a> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">here</a> as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">10 tips on creating the best SOPs</a>, so if you are not sure then take a read of those first.</p>
<p>The definition can be a little fluid however the way we treat SOPs differently from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">Knowledgebase articles</a> is that SOPs are strictly <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for generating technical documentation for different audiences (technical vs non-technical)">non technical related documentation</a> that is based on transferring organizational general purpose knowledge such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">dress standards</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">lunch times </a>and how leave works and how to apply for it.</p>
<p>We deploy the SOPs in the same way we deploy the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">knowledgebase</a> by using your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">documentation platform</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT Glue</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">Hudu</a>.</p>
<p>In our experience, the SOPs are often a task that has been spread over many years using many <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">different staff</a> &amp; because of this, it is often a worthwhile exercise to include this in the project.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Standard Operating Procedure Implementation Project</h2>
<p>We provide a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">standalone project</a> which helps managed service providers implement a standard operating procedure.</p>
<p>SOPs or standard operating procedures are a very important part of running a business not only because they help with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">smooth operations</a> of the business and allow the business to both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">scale upwards</a> as well as down depending on the circumstances, they also help significantly when it comes time to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">sell your MSP business</a>.</p>
<p>A business able to run itself without the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">constant presence of the owner</a> is far more valuable at sale time than a business which requires the owner to be present just to function. Lets face it, if the owner is required then the business is often a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">well paid job</a> with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">far more risk</a>, sometimes not even that.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">SOP Review Audit</h4>
<p>We initially take time to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">review your business</a> and determine if you are operating with any SOPs. While it is rare that a business will operate without any instructions that could be termed standard operating procedures, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">documentation is often very informal</a> and scattered in a variety of places with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">no structure</a> and it is obvious that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/list of high profile backup failures by msps">no planning</a> has ever gone into an SOP framework.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">SOP Initial Review Report And Meeting</h4>
<p>Once the SOP audit is completed, we then <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">undertake a written report</a> where we will either sit down with the owner or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">executive team</a> (<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">virtual meetings</a> are the most common these days) and work through our findings.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">SOP Material Collection</h4>
<p>Once reviewed and our recommendations approved (after any requested adjustments) we will do a more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">comprehensive search</a> for material already created that can be used and implemented.</p>
<p>This material will likely be in the form of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">random documents</a> that have been created over many years. They will be found in company folders, on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">desktops</a>, in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Sharepoint</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">recycle bins</a>, emails, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp application stacks-index-page">PDFs</a> and in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">Teams</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">Skype chats</a>. Our search will be exhaustive as these documents when found will give us the best glimpse of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">company's culture</a> and how you want things to run.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Forensic Knowledge Base Search</h4>
<p>As&nbsp; mentioned in the article I wrote - <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">5 differences between standard operating procedures and knowledge bases</a>, the two sources are often confused and what they see most often is a hybrid monstrosity that combines both types of information in one spot.</p>
<p>This is a terrible situation because you should be attempting to mirror your own company knowledge base so that it shares most of its articles with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">standard client knowledge base</a>. By having a generic component that forms the majority of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">knowledge base</a> it means you can duplicate it with a copy and paste into every single one of your clients.</p>
<p>The problem arises when you have a mixture of internal guidelines that should be separated into the SOP inside your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">KB</a>. Often SOP articles are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">sensitive in nature</a> and not something you want clients to see. It may not be world ending however clients likely do not want to be looking at articles specifying dress codes or the process involved in raising a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">complaint against another employee</a>.</p>
<p>This means of course you cannot do a straight <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">copy or paste</a> of the majority of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">KB</a> into a new client. This is borne out when I have reviewed organizations that have a KSBOP hybrid monster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They approach this by starting from scratch every single time they have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">new client</a>, yes, each client has a different <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">KB structure</a> and each time during the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">client onboarding</a> one of their staff creates a new folder structure and possibly copies a couple of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">generic documents</a> to start them off.<br />All of this wastes significant time and causes <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">user onboarding</a> to take excessive amounts of time.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">SOP Secondary Review Report And Meeting</h4>
<p>We will have collected every document that we can find that could be considered a standard operating procedure and reviewed each one of those documents to understand the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">culture of your business</a>.</p>
<p>We will establish the gaps that your procedures potentially have. Often these documents have been written over a decade by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">countless employees</a> some of which are no longer with you. So we will take time working through these examples with you and establishing which parts and which procedures are now <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">outdated</a> and if they should be eliminated completely or adjusted to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">reflect current standards</a>.</p>
<p>On average, organizations that have not had an official SOP or had anyone assigned to managing one will have less than 30% of the material required to complete an effective SOP.</p>
<p>We have created a SOP template created over the last 10 years that we will use to highlight the areas that are potentially missing.</p>
<p>This is where every organization is different and what is important to you is not important to others and vice versa. We will complete a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">checklist of existing documentation</a> as well as the SOP <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">articles that are missing</a> and that are considered necessary by you.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">SOP Framework Structure Implementation</h4>
<p>We have a base framework of SOP folders based on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">ITGlue documentation platform</a> that we like to use and our experience demonstrates it is the most effective in an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">MSP environment</a>. We use the same framework regardless as to the documentation platform that you use, it could be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Hudu</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Sharepoint</a> or even a set of folders on a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas">NAS drive</a>.</p>
<p>We take that base structure and modify it based on your organization's needs using the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">checklist created</a> during the previous meeting.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Existing SOP Information Update</h4>
<p>We take the existing SOP information found to be used within your organization and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">update each article</a> so that it is current and then eliminate any redundant or superseded information.</p>
<p>Often at this point we will also have to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">combine several items of documentation</a> into one document. One of the issues with having an SOP structure created over a long time frame involving <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">lots of different people</a> is the occurrence of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">repeating the same work</a> over and over again and even worse, not deleting the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">old superseded information</a>.</p>
<p>It is not as simple as straight up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">deleting the old documentation</a> because we often find that the old versions will contain useful and current information that is not in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/vertical apps-index">new versions</a>. This happens all the time so we need to ensure that important steps are not removed by assuming the old version is useless.</p>
<p>We also import or rewrite existing SOPs into the correct and agreed upon <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/training chatgpt to generate documentation that aligns with your companys brand and tone">tone and branding</a> with which you want all of your SOPs to reflect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">normalize the words</a> used as well as apply a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">universal formatting</a> including adhering to rules such as when to use bullet points, how many spaces between paragraphs and how long paragraphs should be. All of these factors determine trust in the information. If they all appear significantly different to each other then <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">trust is lost</a> by your employees.</p>
<p><br />This is done at the time of either <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">rewriting the articles</a> or at import if using something like the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">IT Glue app</a>. If you use a documentation platform then the SOP needs to be integrated into that platform. It takes time but why have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">documentation management platform</a> if you are not going to use it?</p>
<h4 class="display-5">New SOP Information Update</h4>
<p>Once existing SOP articles have been converted and placed into the correct area of the SOP structure, we then create new SOPs based on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">requirements checklist filled out</a>.</p>
<p>This is created in a way that makes full use of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">ITGlue or Hudu</a> page indexing feature so that your staff are presented with a single area with which to access any SOP required.</p>
<p>All articles are named using an agreed to and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">logical naming convention</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Staff Training And SignOff</h4>
<p>Once all of the SOP articles are completed and the SOP structure is finalized along with any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/microsoft-teams-integration">implemented workflow rules</a> and or integration with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp application stacks-index-page">third party applications</a>, we will undertake a period of staff training involving the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">creation of training material</a> in the form of both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">videos</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">how to articles</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">training sessions</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">one on one training</a> if required.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff</a> have been trained in how to access the SOP and on the requirements for updating it we will at that time look to sign off on the project&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From there we can either leave your organization to manage the SOPs themselves or alternatively we do <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">offer service agreements</a> where we manage the documentation component of your business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many good reasons as an MSP to have an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">external company manage your internal documentation</a> which I have written about in another <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">article here</a>.</p>
