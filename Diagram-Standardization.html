            <h1 class="section-title">Diagram Standardization And Integration</h1>
            <p class="intro">Network Diagram Integration And Standardization For Both Internal And Client Facing Situations</p>
<p>Can you think of anything more effective than standardizing the way you create diagrams both internally and for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">clients</a>? I see <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">MSP organizations</a> consistently reinvent the wheel when it comes to both internal network diagrams as well as client diagrams.</p>
<p>This can be quite a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">labor-intensive task</a> however it saves so much time once in place. Our recommendation is to discuss this with the client and aim to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">invoice them</a> for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">work carried out</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, it is a good practice to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">bill your clients</a> for any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation tasks</a> that relate directly to them as I discuss in more detail here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, it directly benefits their organization. It is a good idea for all work carried out for a client to have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">component of labor</a> attached for creating an appropriate level of documentation if the change or service deems it ideal.</p>
<p>If you have hundreds of clients then it makes sense to come up with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index">strategy</a> that injects consistency into the diagram creation process.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Invoicing Clients For Diagram Standardization Project</h2>
<p>This has several benefits, first you get <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">reimbursed for documentation work</a> that directly benefits them which is always a good thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, if a client has paid for say 2 hours of documentation that is accounted for in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">service ticket</a> then your staff have no reason not to spend that allocated time creating the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">required documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a mistake to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">expect staff</a> to do documentation in-between jobs or in their own time as it will not get done or if it does, it will be a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">poor standard</a>. By <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">charging the client</a>, staff are now obligated to provide a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">professional standard</a> the client is happy to pay for.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Type Of Diagrams Standardized</h2>
<p>The type of network diagrams that we specialize in are quite narrow in that they are designed as quick reference for your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">support desk technicians</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">internal techs</a> at your clients. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">ISP information</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">switch IP addresses</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network firewalls index">Firewall Virtual IP addresses</a> as an example, common items that a tech often needs that will give them the best chance of pinpointing common issues.</p>
<p>This solution is not designed for highly complex <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network switch index">Level 3 switching information</a> with in depth information that is rarely used. We make the diagrams as simple as we can get away with while maintaining a high level of usefulness.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Diagram Standardization Project Suitability</h2>
<p>A diagram standardization project is not suitable for everyone. The aim is to make network diagram creation as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">scalable as possible</a> for your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">support desk staff</a> so that even <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">junior members</a> can follow the systems we put in place so that if it is followed, the same outcome is achieved regardless.</p>
<p>Modifications to suit your preference can be included however for it to work, that modification needs to be applied universally for all future diagrams created within your organization.</p>
<p>We integrate the completed diagrams into both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">MYGlue</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/diagram app versus app topics/visio versus lucidchart">LucidChart</a> so a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/diagram app versus app topics/visio versus lucidchart">LucidChart license</a> for your own staff would be required once the signoff is complete.</p>
<p>This is a start to finish system we have developed over 10 years and we have focused on getting good at one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">application</a> that we feel has the most features for MSPs without being <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">overly complex</a>.</p>
<p>We have a library of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">high definition images</a> and a set way of putting a network diagram together. The standardization and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">rigid framework</a> is where the value is with this type of strategy and we understand that it is not for everyone.</p>
<p>If you want to stop having to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">retrain staff</a> on how to create a network diagram everytime a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">new person starts</a> and are continually frustrated by a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">lack of consistency</a> across diagrams then sometimes forgoing the high level of customization and freedom can be the appropriate decision to make.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Diagram Standardization Review Audit</h2>
<p>In a perfect world, you could get all of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">clients onboard</a> with this initiative however if you go in with a plan to slowly chip away at getting your clients to move across to a diagram standard with which you provide then ultimately it allows you to offer a better level of service for them.</p>
<p>The alternative is to attempt to fit in with a different standard for each different client and that option is never good for an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">MSPs profit margin</a>.</p>
<p>We always start with a diagram review audit ideally with your own internal network diagrams.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Diagram Standardization Report And Meeting</h2>
<p>Once we have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">reviewed the structure</a> and current style of your network diagrams, we <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">set a meeting</a> to report our findings and recommendations. This comes in the form of both a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">written report</a> and going through step by step with our findings and recommendations.</p>
<p>It is at this point we discuss any required modifications to the diagram creation strategy.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Existing Diagrams Updated To New Standard</h2>
<p>We then create your network diagrams in the new <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">agreed to standard</a> using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/diagram app versus app topics/visio versus lucidchart">LucidChart</a>. There is normally a range of different network diagrams. On average it may be 8 to 12 network diagrams that we will apply the new strategy to.</p>
<p>Part of this task is sitting down and reviewing the images you want used for the diagrams you will create. The idea is to ensure the images retain the same look and feel <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">across all clients</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you decide to use photorealistic images for all network devices for one client, the expectation would be that you would create all future network diagrams for clients in the same way each time.</p>
<p>This helps clients, keeps the costs to a minimum &amp; increases the trust your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">help desk staff</a> have in the diagrams if they have to use them for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">fault finding purposes</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This flows through to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">tickets getting completed</a> faster &amp; staff on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">support desk</a> under less pressure.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Detailed Creation Guide &amp; Images Package</h2>
<p>After agreement on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">primary hardware items</a> to be used, we then create a repository of High definition images that when coupled with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/microsoft-teams-integration">custom instruction guide</a>, make the outcome of any diagram consistent and expected.</p>
<p>As an example using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">Meraki switches</a>. We would include a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">Meraki</a> image package which allows for a fast creation of realistic HD images in any stack configuration you may need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outcome is achieved using a combination of a single body while mixing the correct type of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">Meraki</a> face plates. It saves someone spending hours looking for a stack configuration identical to the one you need or having a different aspect on every diagram created.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Embedding Diagrams In MYGlue And ITGlue</h2>
<p>Once the initial diagrams are completed, we embed them into the appropriate <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">clients' flexible asset</a>. This gives your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">support staff</a> easy access to key information regardless of location.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Staff Training And SignOff</h2>
<p>Once relevant network diagrams have been completed and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">instruction guides</a> are in place we will undertake training for your staff so that they are able to become self-sufficient in creating network diagrams that are consistent across all of your clients.</p>
<p>By standardizing this part of your MSP it means that your staff will have more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">trust in your documentation</a>, solve <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">service tickets</a> faster and you will be able to onboard new clients faster and appear more professional than your competition.</p>
<p>Lets face it, it has to be better than having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">labor intensive</a>, inefficient network diagram creation where they are squirreled away in random locations that nobody can ever remember when needed and each diagram looking radically different from one to the next.</p>
