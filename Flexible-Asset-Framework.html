            <h1 class="section-title">Fixed Flexible Asset Implementation</h1>
            <p class="intro">Part of the documentation project is to implement a consistent core flexible asset framework.</p>
<p>This does not include the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">automated flexible assets</a> that are part of a different component of the upgrade, it relates to the static flexible assets used by your organization.</p>
<p>While we can separate this from a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">documentation remediation project</a>, there are so many moving parts that often there are a number of other areas that need to be rectified to an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">acceptable standard</a> before working on the flexible assets is feasible. In other words the flexible assets rely heavily on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">current recorded information</a> being accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Without that, it is not feasible to implement these assets successfully. As an example, try connecting <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">password assets</a> to flexible assets when the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">naming convention</a> is all over the place, where there is no consistency and the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">passwords</a> are mixed with old records that are redundant. It becomes an impossible task.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">What Is A Flexible Asset?</h2>
<p>Flexible assets are pretty awesome and really help retain rigidity within your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">documentation framework</a>. To give an analogy, think of an ordinary way to document as if it were a car where it can travel anywhere that has a road, and in that respect it is a highly individual and customized mode of transport.</p>
<p>Now think about a tram where you plan where the tracks are to be positioned and the trams cannot leave those tracks. It is more restrictive however far more efficient and effective if done right.</p>
<p>So you create a flexible asset which is a fancy way of saying a form that integrates with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT Glue</a>. You create fields for each flexible asset in a way that encourages their completion, so drop downs, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">tick boxes</a> and tagging that help you relate other information such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">password records</a>, configurations and other flexible assets to name a few.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">How To Use A Flexible Asset</h2>
<p>I have always considered ITGlue to be the equivalent of an MSP <a href="https://www.lego.com/">lego set</a>. Always work on the small pieces of information first. Get your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">password naming</a> and structure right, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">eliminate duplicate entries</a> and ensure all contacts are syncing perfectly to name a few.</p>
<p>Now you have your lego block with which you can create your flexible assets. Flexible assets are the vehicle with which you link related pieces of information together. The summary page of the relevant flexible asset is the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>As an example, A <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">WAN</a> flexible asset summary page using our strategy would have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">WAN</a> flexible assets for each site as well as the top level <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">WAN</a> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/diagrams-index-page-01">multi site diagram</a> for that client as well as a list of each of the office locations tagged in.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">WAN site summary</a> (next in the hierarchy) would have all the information relating to that particular site including <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network firewalls index">tagged firewalls</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/diagram how to-index-page">site diagram embedded</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/consumer routers">firewall passwords</a> and LAN flexible assets located at that site to name a few.</p>
<p>The important thing to know here is that flexible assets rely heavily on a consistent hierarchy and should be location centric in design.</p>
<p>My recommendation is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">never put restrictions</a> on what to put in. So people will sometimes <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">prevent a flexible asset being saved</a> unless a field is filled out. That is a terrible strategy. It deters people from adding information. I also strongly recommend, when given the choice, putting in text blocks for text fields including <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp-consulting">IP fields</a> because if there is extra information, it can always be accommodated.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to always give the least amount of information possible while not negatively impacting the effectiveness of the flexible asset.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Initial Flexible Asset Audit</h2>
<p>We take all of the current static flexible assets used (Or information that should go in static flex assets) and look for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">commonality across all clients</a> and if need be, adjust our <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">existing templates</a> so they contain information important to your organization.</p>
<p>We then export the existing information in your flexible assets and work through matching the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">old information</a> up with the new structure. During this time there may often be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">poorly structured</a> flexible assets where they need to be modified.</p>
<p>An example of this is when organizations will attempt to use a flexible asset to record a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor organization</a>. This is an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">inefficient and impractical</a> practice where say you have one vendor such as <a href="https://www.synnexcorp.com/">Synnex</a>, they will have to fill out a flexible asset for every single client and in many cases I have seen 30 flexible assets which list the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">contact details</a> and location of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor</a> along with sensitive information such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">account numbers</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">passwords</a>. It is the stuff of nightmares!</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">Creating vendors</a> as organizations significantly speeds up the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">client onboarding process</a>.</p>
<p>Is the Vendor an organization? Do they have an address like an organization? Do they have contacts like an organization? Great, that means they are an organization and need to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">created as an organization</a>.</p>
<p>Create them as an organization and put sensitive client specific information for that vendor in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">password location</a> as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">password</a> and then connect them as related items.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Creation Of Custom Flexible Assets</h2>
<p>We then manually create each of the 14 static flexible assets. There is no way to import a flexible asset structure and this takes time to set up correctly even with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">pre-made templates</a>.</p>
<p>Once the flexible assets have been created, we then import your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">client information</a> back into your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">documentation platform</a> and this information will then populate the newly created flexible assets. The structure across all clients is identical and the information is filled out as completely as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This all sounds very <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">simple and straightforward</a> and it is however we are often needing to work through a decade or so of information and we use this step to cleanse the information of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">superseded information</a> as well as doing our best to verify the accuracy of the information we intend to re-import.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Explanations Of Fixed Flex Assets</h2>
<p>Some of the flexible assets listed above may not be self explanatory so below are the brief explanations of what they are used for.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Application Flexible Asset</h3>
<p>Each significant <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">3rd Party application</a> used by a client has its own flexible asset with relevant configurations and passwords attached in the related items area. The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">summary</a> is just a page where each client's application's flexible assets are tagged in one location. They are broken up into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">application types</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">Finance</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">CRM</a> to name a few.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Backup Flexible Asset Summary</h3>
<p>We tag all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup flexible assets</a> in a location centric way under the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">backup summary</a>. Each <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">individual backup</a> flexible asset is job centric so if there is say a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">Veeam backup job</a> that backs up 15 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">virtual machines</a> then all of the details of that backup will be entered as well as tagged configurations and passwords.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Client Vendor List Flexible Asset</h3>
<p>This is a straight <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">list of vendors</a> the client uses that are tagged in this flexible asset. There are groupings such as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">general vendor section</a> for vendors such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">HP, Dell</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Microsoft</a> and then <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">finance vendors</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/finance apps overview">Intuit</a> etc.</p>
<p>This is a great tool for support desk staff that need a fast way to access contact details for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">3rd party vendors</a> without having to waste time.</p>
<p>If your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">MSP business</a> is large then this can mean hundreds of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">vendor organizations</a> and even though we have templates for the most common, most of your clients will have a number of vendors only they use. Once in place though, new clients can have their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor page</a> completed within seconds &amp; it gives the support desk a fast effective way of obtaining <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">3rd party details for vendors</a> specifically pertaining to that client.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Client Summary Flexible Asset Summary</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client summary</a> flexible asset will have all office locations tagged at the top along with important diagrams such as organizational charts, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/diagrams-index-page-01">miscellaneous diagrams</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">signed contracts</a> and agreements as well as primary contact details and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">escalation points</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Primary Password Flexible Asset Summary</h3>
<p>We have found over the years that 10% of an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">organization's passwords</a> are used 90% of the time and so we created a flexible asset with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">most used passwords</a>. It is broken up into several sections and passwords such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">Domain Admin</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network firewalls index">firewall passwords</a> as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">admin consoles</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">Meraki</a> to name a few. These passwords are tagged to this flexible asset within seconds and rarely change (The password can change many times as it is the record you are tagging)</p>
<h4 class="display-5">WAN Summary Flexible Asset Summary</h3>
<p>We tag all WAN flexible assets in a location centric way under the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">WAN summary</a> where your support staff have the choice to navigate directly to the asset or select the correct location and find all related WAN flex assets under the relevant location.</p>
