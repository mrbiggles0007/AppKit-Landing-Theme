            <h1 class="section-title">Consistency Through Documentation</h1>
            <p class="intro">Managed Service Providers and their relationship with documentation often lack enough consistency over time to make it truly effective.</p>		
<p>We have developed a comprehensive set of principles and practices that are applied via a minimal set of linguistic rules that we apply to all documentation that is created within an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">IT Services organization</a>.</p>
<p>MSPs tend to lack a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01">strong foundation</a> of rules that could simplify the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation process</a>. Our extensive set of guidelines regarding document creation developed specifically for MSPs constrains the type of language and formatting used in documentation so that consistency is retained regardless of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff movements</a> or growth over time. 
<p>Using a rigid language and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation">formatting template</a> developed over 10 years, our blueprint is specifically tailored towards managed service providers and will put structure and consistency into your organization's documentation creation.</p>
<p>Included in any documentation upgrade project we engage in is an internal instance of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/overview of chatgpt and its use with technical documentation relating to managed service providers">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) in the form of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/chatgpt msp apps - index">ChatGPT</a> that is trained using our rules, making it easier for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">your staff</a> to deliver class leading documentation that remains consistent over time.</p>
<p>As a bonus, we are fully conversant with integration of many <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">MSP applications</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">RMMs</a>, PSAs, quoting tools, O365 and file sharing apps into class leading documentation platforms such as IT Glue or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Hudu documentation platforms</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/chatgpt-index-page-01">Artificial intelligence</a> is great for helping build an MSP documentation framework, we attempted to use it to actually <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for collaboration between technical writers and subject matter experts">write articles</a> in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">blog section</a> of our site and it turned out to be a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/overview of chatgpt and its use with technical documentation relating to managed service providers">dreadful failure</a>.
The experience now has us committed to creating MSP related content that is 100% human created.

            <h2 class="section-title">Documentation Pricing Guidelines for I.T Service Providers</h2>
            <div class="intro">As an MSP you have no doubt grappled with the decision on advertising your prices or not. Its a difficult decision to make and no real right or wrong answer.</div>		
<p>Since selling my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">Managed Services Business</a> in 2013 and working exclusively on improving documentation standards in technology based companies, the answer to the question on pricing has become much simpler. We tend to deal with clients that often have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">technical background</a> at some point in their lives. You guys do not need much persuasion on the value of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising facts about managed service providers">simple &amp; consistent documentation</a>. This leads to the situation where what we sell, sells itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">decision maker in an MSP</a>, you understand the huge benefits simplified documentation has on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">economies of scale</a>, you have experience and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">technical competence</a> and can probably pinpoint times in your past where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">poor documentation</a> cost you more hours than you want to admit. Knowing the same thing goes on in your organization is a pretty strong motivator. When the situation exists where the solution is less expensive than the problem, I find it is actually advantageous to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">advertise prices</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">Selling MSP related services</a> is so much more challenging due to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">heavy competition</a>. Coupled with the fact it is difficult for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">potential clients</a> to discern between a high quality MSP that spares no expense seeking excellence and a less competent organization. Being able to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">persuade a potential client</a> that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">complex set of offerings</a> you provide is somehow better than the complex set of offerings the other service provider offers takes an enormous amount of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">persuasive skills and sales ability</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one thing that all potential clients understand and that is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">price</a> or at least they think they do. The amount of times I lost out to other MSPs due to them being far more proficient at <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">structuring pricing</a> so that it looked the lowest at the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">sales meeting</a> yet in reality was far more expensive was numerous. Having consistent trustworthy MSP documentation can help solve that issue by either dropping your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">per user agreement amounts</a> while retaining the same <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">profit margin</a> or keeping them the same and increasing the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">profit margin</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because you will have the ability to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">hire staff</a> who are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">less qualified</a> to do the same work, you can scale up or down at a moment's notice &amp; the time it takes for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">staff to complete tasks</a> will drop significantly. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">Staff retention</a> will also increase if their ability to find the information they need to do their job is easy and it can be treated with a high level of trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They complete tasks faster, feel more competent &amp; as a result are happier working for your organization. Poor documentation is one of the leading causes of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">toxic working environment</a> as it is human nature for people to look for others to blame when tasks take longer than they should. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">Staff retention</a> becomes an issue in environments where there is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">culture of blame</a>. The MSP space is notorious for its high <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff turnover</a> due to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">high stress environments</a> we tend to work in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">your staff</a> feel like superstars and they will repay you with years of loyalty. You win on either side of the equation, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employing less experienced staff</a> (cheaper) who need less <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">onboarding time</a> &amp; that will stay with you longer while maintaining the same or better service levels. I have never liked playing pricing games in an attempt to win business. If you are reading this then you are aware your documentation is an issue, you realize the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">massive potential savings</a> to your business there is in implementing an effective documentation framework on a strong foundation that will remain consistent over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amounts listed here are insignificant compared to the savings you will make. The solution in many ways sells itself.</p>

The tools we use have evolved and are so much more powerful than the roll your own methods of the past. Unfortunately as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">MSP's technology improved</a>, we got busier. We had enough time to swipe the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">credit card</a> and enter into a multi year contract for a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">documentation platform</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT Glue</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">Hudu</a> however were unable to really devote the time needed to make the most of the platform.<br /><br />Documentation management platforms for MSP's are not cheap &amp; yet most organizations are using them as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">glorified password managers</a>.
