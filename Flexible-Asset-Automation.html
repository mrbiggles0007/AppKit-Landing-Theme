            <h1 class="section-title">Flexible Asset Automation</h1>
            <p class="intro">We are able to setup automation for 14 of the most common flexible asset types.</p> 
<p>Flexible asset automation via the API of either <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">Hudu</a> is such a great <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">time saving exercise</a>. Using something like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Automate</a> or other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">RMM tool</a>, we set up the automated flexible assets below to run on a regular schedule.</p>
<p>Anywhere from once per day to once a week works well and does impact the operational side of the servers that you run them from. We can install these as part of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">MSP documentation upgrade</a> and the process of setting them up is relatively straight forward.</p>
<p>The main delay in setting up flexible asset <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">powershell scripts</a> is the amount of servers out there that still only have a very <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">old version of Powershell</a>. Upgrading a servers <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">powershell version</a> often requires a reboot making this quite a disruptive evolution and one that requires a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">well thought out communication plan</a> to keep your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">clients happy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Liongard Roar Experiences</h2>
<p>I have engaged with many companies that pay for Liongard and I have never really warmed to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scripts listed below will collect most of the otherwise <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">labor intensive</a> manual collection of information and do it error free using existing tools. They can be easily set up by a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">support technician</a> with medium levels of skill and they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">do not duplicate records</a> into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> like Liongard does.</p>
<p>That has always been my pet hate of Liongard, initially I thought I had misconfigured it and followed up with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">support</a>. I was finding thousands of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">configuration duplicates</a> in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">IT Glue</a> which of course creates <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">severe trust issues</a> when there are multiple records for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">same device</a>.</p>
<p>I found out that having duplicates is how Liongard works. So say you have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">server</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">workstation</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">firewall</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">switch</a> that is automatically created as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">configuration device</a> within <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liongard will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">not overlay the information</a> it finds on that device and add it to the configuration, instead it creates the device as a flexible asset so you have a flexible asset and a configuration of the same device, it was a nightmare.</p>
<p>Even worse, it applies an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">automated naming convention</a> that cannot be changed. Do not get me wrong, it has the ability to convey massive amounts of raw data into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> and I know quite a few organizations that have invested considerable time into setting it up correctly and are happy with it.</p>
<p>The biggest issue for me with Liongard is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">significant investment required</a> to get it anywhere near effective and as above, it turns any beautifully curated <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue system</a> into an awful mess.</p>
<p>Ultimately I have found the collection of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">powershell scripts</a> below handle automating everything you need and integrate with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> far better than Liongard can. The final straw for me is that they have downsized recently and layed off a sizable portion of their workforce.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">Automated Flexible Asset Benefits</h2>
<p>There are two main benefits derived from automating flexible asset updates, first is that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">human error</a> is eliminated. It is the biggest issue with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">entering updated information</a> into your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp documentation apps overview">documentation application</a> and that is the large number of errors introduced.</p>
<p>The second is the excessive amount of time required to update massive amounts of information means that when it comes to some of the information that is updated automatically such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">AD administrator accounts</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">Remote user login sessions</a> under <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/physical servers index">relevant servers</a>, it is just too impractical to manually add this information in and keep it updated.</p>
<p>I have seen so many times where companies will go in with a great deal of enthusiasm and actually spend significant time on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">manually entering data</a> that changes regularly. Of course it is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">outdated</a> almost before the data entry has even finished and then <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">nobody ever updates it</a> again.</p>
<p>This means the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">significant manual effort</a> was wasted and the information is untrustworthy. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">Help desk staff</a> then stop using it and before you know it, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">expensive documentation software</a> you purchased is turned into a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">glorified password manager</a>.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">Flexible Asset Automation</h2>
<p>We are able to set up automation for 15 of the most useful types of information.</p>
<p>Part of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">documentation improvement process</a> is to automate as much as possible. It cuts down on human error &amp; also ensures the information is up to date. Below are the flexible asset types we can automate.<br /></p>
