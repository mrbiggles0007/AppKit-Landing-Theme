            <p class="intro">We can assist in moving your documentation records from IT Glue to Hudu using automation.</p>
<p>One of the issues that many of the businesses using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> have come up against is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">lack of ongoing development</a> with IT Glue and the way in which they appear to treat their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">clients</a>. For many years there was not a reasonable alternative as ITGlue as it stands has been and is still arguably the premier <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation management platform</a>.</p>
<p>Most of their clients never really had an issue with their product, it was more that they knew how good it was and that they had <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">no competition</a>. Instead of continuing to improve upon the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">base product</a>, development languished and basic features such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">automated backups</a> were ignored for years.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="display-6">IT Glue Never Had An Acceptable Backup</h2>
<p>Even though a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">scheduled backup</a> was the number 1 request on the IT Glue site for years and as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/vertical apps-index">programmatically</a> as simple as it would have been to achieve, it never happened.</p>
<p>To the point that a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">backup script</a> created by the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">community</a> was released to address this shortcoming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">community</a> did their best, it is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">not a true backup</a>. It backs up into a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">basic csv file</a> &amp; does not <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backup</a> the work that can often culminate in thousands of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">hours of work</a>. Things like associations between <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">configurations</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">flexible assets</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">passwords</a> and documents. The very features that make IT Glue so popular are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liability waiver when client declines msp backup recommendation">not backed up</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Kaseya Purchase Of IT Glue</h2>
<p>Being bought out by Kaseya has not seemed to help the situation in actual fact it seems to have only gotten worse especially when <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">predatory practices</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">high pressure sales</a> &amp; automated roll over of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">long term contracts</a> have been implemented, it is no wonder that there has been an increased demand for migration services out of IT Glue.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">IT Glue Compared To Hudu</h2>
<p>A couple of years ago, Hudu <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">entered the market</a> and while rough around the edges it provided a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">minimum set of features</a> that MSPs could work with. It also has built features such as customizable dashboards which do not exist in IT Glue and their investment in development means over time their product should <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">exceed the features and reliability</a> of IT Glue at some point.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">All That Is Hudu Does Not Shine</h2>
<p>I understand that people are sick to death of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">Kaseya business practices</a> however I have seen very little criticism of some of the issues with Hudu. I have always put a strong value on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">locations</a> within ITGlue because the first question with many assets is always going to be &ldquo;<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services"><em>Where is it located</em></a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hudu has had a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">feature request</a> to sync locations from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Manage</a> for well over 2 years now with no feedback except for that it is &ldquo;<em>in progress</em>&rdquo; This is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">basic feature</a> in ITGlue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 way sync to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">PSA</a> is not a feature in Hudu while this is just expected in ITGlue so the expectation of say modifying a contact in Hudu is not currently possible, this feature request is well over 3 years old now and is still in the planned state.</p>
<p>There are other annoying issues such as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers">O365 integration syncing</a> every single contact including external users meaning Hudu gets flooded with contacts. This makes the integration all but <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">unusable</a> in my opinion. Then there is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/wireless hardware">Unifi integration</a> which was planned years ago too although the community have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">created a script</a> which will circumvent the need for an in app solution.</p>
<p>While their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">product development</a> is better than ITGlue, it is still not great, communication is average and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">feature requests</a> are set to planned and it appears <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">never looked at again</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Our IT Glue Migration Services</h2>
<p>We provide a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/microsoft-teams-integration">migration path</a> from IT-Glue as either a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">standalone service</a> or as part of a documentation migration project. Our recommendation is to use the migration as a tool to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">clean up your documentation</a>, leaving the dead wood behind.</p>
<p>Below is a list of records that we can help migrate to Hudu</p>

<div data-linkz-ai-container>
<p>It is important to note that IT Glue does not make migration an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">easy process</a> and there is a lot of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">manual work required</a> as well as the migrated records often are unpredictable in what arrives at the other side.</p>
<p>Things like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/diagram-standardization">image</a> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">links in flexible assets</a> or documents will likely be broken and the formatting can be horrifically messed up and this will need to be rectified. Because of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">unpredictability</a> we recommend running Hudu side by side with IT Glue for a month or so (continuing to use ITG as the production version) The migration will involve <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">multiple test imports</a> undertaken to establish how your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">specific information reacts</a> to the importation process. This will often involve <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">modifying information</a> on the source side (ITG) and undertaking <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">test imports</a> or it could require exports/data modification/imports on the source side of the migration prior to exporting to Hudu.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Records That Will Not Migrate</h2>
<p>There are a number of items below that will not import into Hudu in the artifact free way one would expect or at least hope. I have listed a number of areas where you can <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">expect issues</a>. My advice is to not <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">always believe</a> how rosy the outlook is with Hudu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People migrating <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">feel so violated</a> by the treatment they received from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">Kaseya</a> and when coupled with the fact Hudu is the only viable alternative, it often means that they are unwilling to voice some of the problems migrating from one to the other causes. It is important to remember that IT Glue has about a 10 year head start over Hudu in the maturity stakes.</p>
<p>Spend time coming up with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">list of features</a> that are a must have as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">develop a budget</a> including lost time involved in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">training staff</a> and the lead time required for getting to know a new&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Import And Export Not Perfect</h4>
<p>No matter what you do, the import/export/import/<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">API process</a> is not going to be perfect. ITG does <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">not make it easy</a> to walk your information out of the door to another provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matching items will not be 100% perfect and there <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">will be duplicates</a> and odd results. It goes without saying that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">more information</a> and clients you have, the more time it will take to undertake the migration and the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">more disruption</a> that will occur.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Tagged Items And Associated Records</h4>
<p>This is the kicker for many, especially those that have more than 500 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">clients</a> and have widely implemented all of the associated items and tagging features that IT Glue offers. Unfortunately the scripting involved to retain the associated items and tagged information of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">old flexible assets</a> is at best hit and miss and at worst, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">requires manual application</a> of these items.</p>
<p>Documents in IT Glue do not have API access meaning that we need to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">export them as html</a> files. This can be done at scale however the formatting is not perfect and depending on the original formatting, sometimes it is easier to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">copy and paste</a> versus importing after taking into account the time it takes to rectify the problems that come across during the import stage.</p>
