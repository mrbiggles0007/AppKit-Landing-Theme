            <h2 class="section-title">ITGlue To Hudu Migration Services</h2>
            <p class="intro">We can assist in moving your documentation records from IT Glue to Hudu using automation.</p>
One of the issues that many of the businesses using IT Glue have come up against is the lack of ongoing development with IT Glue and the way in which they appear to treat their clients.
For many years there was not a reasonable alternative as IT Glue as it stands has been and is still arguably the premier documentation management platform.
			<br></br>
Most of their clients never really had an issue with their product, it was that they knew how good it was and that they had no competition. Instead of continuing to improve upon
the base product, development languished and basic features such as automated backups were ignored for years. To the point that a script created by the community was released to
 address this shortcoming.
 			<br></br>
 Being bought out by Kaseya has not seemed to help the situation especially when predatory practices such as high pressure sales & automated roll over of long term contracts
  have been implemented, it is no wonder that their has been an increased demand for migration services out of IT Glue.
 			<br></br>
 Even then, it is not a true backup. It backs up into a basic csv file & does not backup the work that can often culminate in thousands of hours of work. Things like associations between
  configurations, flexible assets, passwords and documents. The very features that make IT Glue so popular are not backed up.
  			<br></br>
  A couple of years ago, Hudu entered the market and while rough around the edges it provided a minimum set of features that MSPs could work with. It also has built features such as 
  dashboards which do not exist in IT Glue and their investment in development means over time their product should exceed the features and reliability of IT Glue at some point.
  			<br></br>
  We provide a migration path from IT-Glue as either a standalone service or as part of a documentation migration project.
  Our recommendation is to use the migration as a tool to clean up your documentation, leaving the dead wood behind.
