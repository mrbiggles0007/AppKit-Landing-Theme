            <p class="intro">Duplicate information eats away at the trust your staff have for the information systems you have in place.</p>
<p>Duplicates kill trust in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">system</a> faster than anything else. The first thing most of us think when we see a contact list with 8 entries of the same contact that are all slightly different is to discount it any further and ask someone for the details or look for an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">old excel staff list</a>. Both of which circumvent the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">information system</a> you have in place that is meant to make things easier.</p>
<p>Duplicates happen for many reasons, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">systems</a> may not have been integrated using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">best practices</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">ongoing maintenance</a> may be non-existent or incorrect information could have been entered in the wrong places to name a few.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Types Of Information Duplication</h2>
<p>Below are some of the examples of information duplication that commonly exists within <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">managed service providers</a> when we first undertake a deduplication audit.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Contact Duplication</h4>
<p>This occurs when you have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">multiple MSP systems</a> that have not been <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">integrated correctly</a>. I have personally seen clients operating with three or more identical contacts in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">IT Glue and Hudu</a>.</p>
<p>Like human beings everywhere, they get used to the status quo. The longer you leave a contact duplicate situation, the worse it gets because your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">help desk people</a> are likely to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">randomly assign tickets</a> to one of the 3 options meaning that if it is left for too long, it can be quite an ordeal to rectify.</p>
<p>Generally contacts will sync with your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">PSA</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Manage</a> and if <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">not set up correctly</a> or by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">people not experienced</a>, they will often create contacts in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> or Hudu instead of allowing contacts to sync both ways. So that can end up giving you two contacts that are identical.</p>
<p>You can also end up with three or even 4 duplicates of the same contact if you do not set up the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/data retention for ex365 employees">Office 365 integration</a> correctly as well as integrating your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">RMM monitoring tool</a> correctly as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get some people do not use contacts in their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">documentation integration application</a>, all I can say in this situation is that if your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">IT documentation program</a> is not contact centric then you at most are getting perhaps 40% effective use out of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">application</a>.</p>
<p>Invest your time in getting your contact duplicates eliminated from all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">applications</a>. Your documentation program should not be your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">application</a> of truth. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Manage application</a> or other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">PSA</a> should be the program where contacts flow from.</p>
<p>You can add contacts from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT-Glue</a> and they will sync to most PSAs; however, you should always treat the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">PSA</a> as the more accurate copy of your contacts. Delete any unwanted client contacts from your PSA and then check for orphans in ITG and delete those.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend that you ensure that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/data retention for ex365 employees">Office 365 integration</a> aligns with your PSA contacts and they flow through to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITG</a>. Until this is completed successfully, it is best not to rely on contacts in your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">documentation platform</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Location Deduplication</h4>
<p>This is another big area that organizations believe is not that big of a deal. Rarely do we see MSPs that have implemented an accurate and consistent <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">naming convention</a> for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client sites</a>. It is almost always left as &ldquo;<em>Main</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find this odd considering that after a specific contact the next question we have is &ldquo;<em>where are they located?</em>&rdquo; Good luck when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">new hire</a> has to guess from memorable names like &ldquo;<em>warehouse, second site, foothills office or 3rd floor office</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Locations need a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">consistent naming convention</a> across all clients and they must be created in the PSA rather than <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT Glue</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">Hudu</a>. Yes you can create a location in ITG however it has always been buggy and often will create a duplicate and then sync twice.</p>
<p>Other applications that are location centric such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">Meraki</a> need to have some thought put into them so that they align with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">naming convention</a> of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> otherwise you will end up with multiple locations that are the same place.</p>
<p>Ensure that your locations in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp monitoring apps-index-page">Connectwise Automate</a> or other RMM are identical to the locations in both CW Manage and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT Glue</a>. Make sure that the PSA is the source for all other integrated applications.</p>
<p>Sometimes people <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/industrial computers">group devices</a> under device types and use the location for that in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">Meraki</a>. I recommend not doing that because the location should be used for the location, it is better to break those devices up into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">separate groups</a> based on their physical location rather than having 2000 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/wireless hardware">wifi access points</a> in a group called <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/wireless hardware">WiFi APs</a>.</p>
<p>If this all seems like too much then I encourage you to contact us as we are experienced in untangling duplicate and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">mismatched information</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Deduplication Of Configurations</h4>
<p>The most common problem I see with configurations is when the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">integration is set up incorrectly</a>. This can be quite a serious and time consuming problem to rectify because people will sometimes enter extra information into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">configurations manually</a> as well as tag configurations to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">flexible assets</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">passwords</a>.</p>
<p>I have seen some clients that will have north of 30,000 duplicate configurations all with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">manual information</a> added and having been tagged to various assets. Significant amounts of time are often invested in linking up duplicate assets that require even more time to untangle.</p>
<p>So picture looking at up to 4 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">server configurations</a> that are all identical then going into each one and seeing varying amounts of related items attached to each one. Which one do you keep?</p>
<p>There is no way to merge configurations, you have to delete the ones that you do not want. While ITG allows you to backup a flat <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">excel spreadsheet</a>, it does not export the related items information or tagged information, you lose it all.&nbsp; Now picture doing that 5000 times?</p>
<p>See how it becomes almost an impossible task to rectify this without burning everything to the ground and starting from scratch. Thankfully the organizations that tend to have large issues with duplicate configurations often have not used <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> to its full potential and so there is not a huge number of related items we have to worry about.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Configuration Duplicate Solutions</h4>
<p>Our recommendation in this situation is to either call us for assistance and failing that, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">export the csv</a> from ITG and look for patterns as to where the duplicates are coming from. The biggest culprit is usually your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">RMM tool</a> such as Connectwise Automate.</p>
<p>The biggest configuration mistake I see is when the configuration integration is set up both ways between the PSA and both ways between the RMM. This is a recipe for duplicate city and deleting them will not matter, they will come right back during the next sync.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to only sync 2 ways between ITGlue and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise PSA</a> coupled with syncing from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">Connectwise Automate</a> to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">CW Manage</a>. This ensures that chances of duplicates are heavily reduced. Nothing should be syncing configurations back to the RMM.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Configurations Outside An RMM Do Not Exist</h4>
<p>This is a problem I often see and it means you put your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">MSP organization</a> into a corner and it means any work undertaken with configurations is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">labor intensive</a> because you cannot just hit the delete button and expect all of your configurations to come back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a few percent of your configurations are manually created then it means having to review every single duplicate configuration record to check if it is automatic or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">Documentation systems</a> are meant to make life easier. If you have spent money on an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">RMM system</a> then use it. If the configuration does not exist in the RMM so that it can be synced via the PSA and onto ITGlue then <strong>DO NOT</strong> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">manually create the configuration</a>.</p>
<p>Fix the problem on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">RMM</a> side. If the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">RMM</a> does not detect the device then fix the issue with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">SNMP</a> or install the probe in the right location. Do anything <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">except add a manual configuration</a> record because it is the least automated thing you could do and is completely impractical and there is no ability to keep track of these configurations which are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">hugely labor intensive</a> to create.</p>
<p>If you take anything away from this article, I hope it is a dislike of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">manual configuration entries</a>. You should be able to delete every single configuration from IT Glue and feel comfortable that every single record will sync back at the next sync cycle.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Office 365 Tenants Must Match Connectwise Organizations</h4>
<p>I have seen enough examples of mismatches between <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for msps">O365 tenants</a> and other integrated systems within an MSP to know you guys cut corners on the documentation side whenever you are asked to make a change.</p>
<p>So <strong>Company-A</strong> buys <strong>Company-B</strong> or <strong>Company-B</strong> breaks off into <strong>Company-C</strong> and <strong>D</strong> and you make those changes in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise manage</a> and you give the client a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">good price</a> on the change if you even charge them at all and give yourself a little pat on the back.</p>
<p>Only you did the tasks that are easy but left out the important task brushing them off as not important and I suppose to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client</a> they probably are not that important because it is you that is going to be the one exposed to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">inefficiency</a> caused by these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">serious oversites</a>.</p>
<p>I have spoken about this before and strongly recommend that you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">charge your clients appropriately for documentation work</a> and that includes any work where there is a change to their company structure.</p>
<p>I realize it's a hassle, is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">labor intensive</a> and&nbsp; you do not see the upside but for the love of god, if your clients split into two companies or merge with another then modify their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">O365 tenant</a> to reflect the change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wasted time having to explain to every <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">new hire</a> that the contacts in ITG under <strong>company-A</strong> actually are for <strong>Company-B</strong> in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">CWM</a> is infuriating especially after they may have spent 20 minutes trying to figure the problem out for themselves, not to mention the potential for complications when it comes to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">cyber security insurance policy</a> if your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client entities</a> are a jumbled mess.</p>
<p>There is no excuse, either use your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">documentation platform</a> and invest the time so it will save you time or run the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">support desk</a> out of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">notepad</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">sharepoint</a>. No half measures!</p>
<p>You have to ask yourself, if nobody is using the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">documentation platform</a> your organization is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">paying a substantial amount</a> for, what is the point in it beyond a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">glorified password manager</a>?</p>
<p>It has the capability to be so much more but for that to happen, deduplication of records and elimination of orphans is an absolute must.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">How We Handle A Duplicate Elimination Project</h2>
<p>We recommend engaging us as part of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation remediation step</a>, to confirm all systems are correctly integrated. Once confirmed and after a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">full backup</a> is undertaken, we go through and clean up all duplicates and orphan records in the system. There can be some complexity involved with some systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have created a set of deduplication templates we have developed over the last 10 years that helps us step through the various scenarios you may see yourself in.</p>
<p>While a deduplication project can be undertaken as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">standalone documentation project</a>, there are often areas that may need to be rectified as part of this project and we will need to determine those items as part of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">documentation remediation audit</a> prior to any remedial work taking place.</p>
