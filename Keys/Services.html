            <h2 class="section-title">Services Provided</h2>
            <p class="intro">Our primary focus on initial engagement is to formulate a plan tailored to your business that will improve the consistency, trust and usability of your current Documentation framework.</p>
			<h2 class="section-title">Review Phase</h2>
			The first step is a full overview of how you use your documentation platform and there is no one size fits all. You may be a mid-sized company with 5 clients that only maintains their networking infrastructure.
			In that case, setting up syncing of thousands of workstations and other devices that will never be used by your staff will just cause more problems than it solves. You may have 200 smaller clients where workstations are an important
			device to have synced into your documentation platform. We will take your primary business focus into account & will use that to formulate our recommendations.
			<br></br>
			<h2 class="section-title">Remediation Phase</h2>
			After the recommendations are made and any adjustments made, we recommend putting those recommendations into place. At this point, you can decide to go as far as the review and not go ahead with remediation. Some organizations will
			take those recommendations & use in house staff to implement the changes. 
			<br></br>
			Due to a number of operational issues that are in play, most organizations find it preferable to have us implement the changes. Committing to improve the way you access and record information is a big step and things will get worse before they get better.
			It is quite amazing to see what human beings will adapt to and any new process that goes in will require a period of learning as well as unlearning the old way. During this time whatever system you currently have in place will be faster for existing staff.
			<br></br>
			The aim is to put in place a system that is intuitive, consistent and trustworthy allowing less experienced staff to handle tasks that they would be unable to without access to trustworthy information they need to do the job at hand.
			<br></br>
			The changes required around existing staff needing to document to an adequate level can cause frustration & it is vital that the leadership understands and is fully behind the planned improvements. Without the regular participation
			and enthusiasm of at least one key senior staff member (Preferably Non Technical) in the organization, this type of initiative will rarely succeed long term.
			<br></br>
			<h2 class="section-title">Maintenance Phase</h2>
			The speed with which a beautifully crafted, logical & consistent documentation framework can fall apart the moment we walk out the door cannot be underestimated. Technicians have a fairly stressful time of things
			and following standards that will make things easier long term get dropped if it saves 10 mins in the short term. It is just a fact of life, nobody's fault and sometimes other avenues need to be taken to ensure the
			long term success of the project. That is why we offer the maintenance phase.
			<br></br>
			Think of it like a MDSP if you will, a Managed Documentation Services Provider where we ensure standards are maintained and as long as techs are able to put the vital information somewhere in the system then we can take care of
			ensuring the entries adhere to the naming convention for passwords/documents/configurations/flexible assets etc. If the information is not provided then we will follow up with the tech in question to obtain a minimum amount of information.
			It is all about putting the least amount of information while still being effective.
			<br></br>
			<h2 class="section-title">Maintenance Phase Requirements</h2>
			We only agree to maintain areas of your documentation platform that have already gone through the remediation process. As an example, you may require your knowledgebase to be maintained so that it is kept to a certain standard.
			There needs to be a line in the sand so that we can take over. During the remediation process for the knowledgebase as an example, we go through and take all those documents regarding installation of NT 4.0 SP4 or Vista troubleshooting steps
			and clean these out (if appropriate). 
			<br></br>
			We rename every single document, move SOPs out of the knowledge base, implement a folder structure that is identical across all clients and then update the remaining documents so that they are all formatted exactly the same.
			The headings will all be the same size fonts, same line spacing between paragraphs, normalise the language across all documents. 
			<br></br>
			When a person unfamiliar with your organization starts working for you, they will quickly start to trust the system as every single document is formatted the same way, written in the same way & has a logical name allowing global search features granular functionality unavailable when 20 techs are allowed to name a document without in place guidelines.
			Once all these tasks are completed in the remediation phase, we can ensure the standards put in place do not slip and the investment is not lost.
			<br></br>
			A small example of how normal it is for organizations to have serious efficiency problems with knowledgebase guides is something as simple as adding an Active Directory user with O365 and a signature application. It is normal to see an organization
			with 100 clients where most are using Active Directory and having 100 instruction guides on how to undertake this task that are all vastly different to each other and all trying to achieve the exact same result.
			<br></br>
			You can pretty much work out if it was a Friday afternoon by the way the guide trails off and niceties like screenshots are non existent by the end.
			This lack of consistency destroys the trust the people these documents are aimed at have in these documents.
			<br></br>
			We will export these guides into Excel and normalize them so that there is a universal set of steps that include screenshots and we end up with a single document that now becomes a template for all existing and future clients using AD.
			The key is to separate the client specific information from the knowledgebase guides so that the guide itself is just a generic form that staff members come to trust because it is the same across all clients.
			The client specific information is separated, ideally into a form that they need to fill out that automatically creates a ticket. 
			<br></br>
			It also means your help desk is not playing phone tag after a client has sent in a cryptic request with almost none of the information you require. The job does not start until the form arrives at the support desk & it is required to be filled in full.
			By now you are thinking, "these guys are not engaged in rocket science, I could do this" You would be correct, the problem is, it rarely happens. All we do is apply a framework that we know works and ensure there is consistency and logic applied.
