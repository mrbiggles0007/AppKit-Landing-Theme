            <p class="intro">Utilize the power of Microsoft Teams along with SharePoint and OneDrive in your documentation framework strategy.</p>
<p>One of the great myths when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation management</a> is that there is an optimum way with which to have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">single data silo of information</a> for your organization.</p>
<p>I am here to tell you it is a pipe dream that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">documentation application vendors</a> tell you is possible in the hope you will sign up for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">application</a> they are trying to sell you.</p>
<p>Thankfully there are a few <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">applications included</a> with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for msps">Office 365</a> with which you can give yourself the greatest chance of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">success </a>when putting a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">documentation strategy</a> in place.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Best Documentation Strategy?</h2>
<p>My completely impartial and benevolent advice is to use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">Optimized Documentation</a> and the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">documentation services</a> we provide as we have been through all of the pain and frustration involved in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">doing things wrong</a> over the years so that you do not have to.</p>
<p>Failing that, I will give a few tips that have worked for us over the years and that give consistent and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">reliable results</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Microsoft Teams With Sharepoint And OneDrive</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">datastore</a> for MS Teams, Sharepoint and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">OneDrive</a> is the same place. What I mean by that is that if you change a file in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Onedrive</a> then that will also be modified in both Teams And Sharepoint.</p>
<p>The idea is to duplicate the folder structure that is in your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">documentation application</a> with the folder structure in the above 3 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Microsoft applications</a>. This is where some planning is required as to how the folder structure should work and the folder structure should be identical both in your own company as well as your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">clients</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Documentation Structure In ITGlue</h4>
<p>I have seen so many convoluted setups where there are up to four different organizations with which the MSP is represented within <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT Glue</a>. Some will have a separate organization just for their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">knowledgebase</a>, another for their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">Standard Operating Procedures</a> and then split their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">data center</a> up so it is a separate entity and finally their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">MSP organization</a>.</p>
<p>There is no need for these complex structures, they just introduce <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">massive amounts of confusion</a> and are unnecessary. Treat your MSP as if it is no different from any other client within IT Glue and there should be only a single organization representing it. If you have a separate organization for documentation then that extra complexity needs to be eliminated.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Documentation Folder Structure</h4>
<p>One great benefit regarding creating document folders in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT Glue</a> is unlike the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">password folder structures</a> they can be easily imported via the import feature on the right hand side. From memory, you just paste the folder structure in each folder and select import.</p>
<p>This saves significant time as you need to do this for each client. Yes it will take a little time if you have several hundred clients but it is worth it. I have had <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">techs</a> go rogue on me in the past and start deleting folders from each client which are not used for that client.</p>
<p>Do not allow them to do this. You will hear seemingly rational reasons such as &ldquo;<em>but this client does not use AD so why have the folder?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reason is that you always want to produce a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">documentation framework</a> that is consistent across the board as it <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">instills trust</a> amongst those with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">less experience</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">Active Directory folder</a> is located in the same place in the KB for every single client then <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">your staff</a> will come to expect it there, they will take comfort that every single client is the same. If your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">senior tech</a> goes on a deletion spree and you end up with 200 different variations of the folder structure then not only has that taken time to do, it also introduces inconsistency and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">lack of trust</a> amongst your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">junior staff</a>.</p>
<p>It causes both the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">client onboarding</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">offboarding tasks</a> to take longer as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">new staff</a> have to double check items they are not sure of such as &ldquo;<em>did they forget to add that folder or do they not need that folder</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>How come this client does not have any folders, I will have to put the ticket on hold and follow it up</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">teach your staff</a> to accept that if the folder is empty then it means we do not have the documentation or process then they are less likely to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">second guess</a> themselves and ask questions which end up interrupting their effectiveness as well as others.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">ITG Folder Contents Organization</h4>
<p>So you now have imported the suite of folders you want to use for every single client across your organization and they are now identical across every single client in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITG</a>.</p>
<p>Now is the time to organize any existing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> documents into the relevant document folder for each one of your clients as well as the MSP (which should be treated like any other client) Brace yourself as this could take some time to complete as you may have hundreds or even thousands of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITG</a> documents to sort through.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Create Microsoft Teams For Client Data Structure</h4>
<p>Once the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITG</a> document folder structure is completed, I have found the best way depending on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">number of clients</a> is to segregate clients into MS Teams using a Team. I have found the best way of doing that especially if you have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">large number of clients</a> (more than 100) is to create a team called <strong>A-F</strong> followed by <strong>H-L</strong> etc so that they are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">easily manageable</a> from within Teams.</p>
<p>The team names can be variable and it would depend on the amount of clients you currently have and your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">expectation of growth</a>. Once the teams are in place then create channels within the relevant team so for example a client named <strong>Alfalfa Holdings</strong> would go into the team called <strong>A-F</strong> and you would create a channel within the team called <strong>Alfalfa Holdings</strong> (identical to the client name in ITG)</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Sync Sharepoint To OneDrive Local</h4>
<p>Because the team and channel folders and their contents are the same information as what is in both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Sharepoint and Onedrive</a>, the exact structure will appear in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Sharepoint</a>. Now if you enjoy pain you could certainly create one folder at a time in Teams or Sharepoint under each client and you may even complete that by 2045.</p>
<p>Alternatively get on a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">desktop</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/business notebooks &amp; laptops">notebook</a> and set up onedrive for business. Now within Sharepoint navigate to within the Team folder and at the top there is a sync button. It will ask you if you want to sync the Sharepoint folder with Onedrive and the team folders will be synced to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">desktop</a> under Onedrive.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Copy Folder Structure Into Local OneDrive</h4>
<p>You can either copy a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">master copy</a> of your folder structure in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITGlue</a> or there are heaps of utilities out there that will take the flat import file you used in ITG to create a folder structure in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">windows</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming you have an empty set of folders that make up your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">knowledge base folder structure</a> and it is identical to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">ITG</a> document folder structure, you can copy and then paste into each one of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">created channels</a>.</p>
<p>Remember the channels are just showing as subfolders under the Teams folders in OneDrive and each folder will be named after one of your clients. Now it may take a bit of time however even with 200+ clients, it should not take more than an hour to copy into each channel an identical folder structure. Again there are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">plenty of utilities</a> that can automate this step.</p>
<p>The syncing with OneDrive is 2 way so the document folder structure will be available for viewing under both Teams and Sharepoint within a short amount of time.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Populating Client Knowledge Base Folders</h4>
<p>Once the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/diagram-standardization">diagram folder structure</a> is in place for all of your clients then the tedious step of collecting documents from every place they are currently kept should be searched. This includes but is not limited to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">portable hard disks</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">peoples desktops</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">shared server drives</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network attached storage">network server shares</a> and existing Sharepoint repositories to name a few.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">not a small task</a> especially if you have a decade or so of documents strewn across the entire organization. Part of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">effort invested</a> here should be spent on eliminating as much <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">outdated or duplicated content</a> that you can.</p>
<p>I used to have an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">unsorted folder</a> where any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">documents that needed review</a> would be placed in that folder for that particular client. There should also be extensive and ongoing communication with all levels in the company. The last thing you need is for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">top sales guy</a> losing the plot because a potentially <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">huge contract</a> is at <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">risk</a> because they cannot find the information they need in the new folder system.</p>
<p>Always have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup of the system</a> as it was prior to any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">work undertaken</a> and along with that have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/msp backups - client expectations">plan to restore</a> the information and the expected <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups">time frames for restoration</a> widely advertised across the organization.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend sorting all documentation from a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">desktop</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/business notebooks &amp; laptops">notebook</a> using Onedrive as it allows for the fastest way to undertake this task. Any other method is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">impractical</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Folder Structure Now Identical Across Organization</h4>
<p>Having completed the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">integration</a> with Teams/Sharepoint/OneDrive with IT Glue it now means that there is no requirement to figure out where information is located in one place and attempt to translate where it should be in the other location.</p>
<p>So I advise to only store <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">ITGlue created documentation</a> in ITGlue because it does a dreadful job as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">storage location</a> for things like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">word documents</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">PDFs</a> and that sort of thing. Trust me it will never work out if you attempt to shoehorn everything into your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">documentation platform</a>.</p>
<p>The beauty of identical folder structures is knowing where everything lives. So say you have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">client summary flexible asset</a> and one of the sections is to allow you to upload the signed PDF contract for each client.</p>
<p>Instead of spending half an hour searching in 3 different locations before giving up, you now know that each client will have their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">signed contracts</a> located in the <strong>/Signed Contracts</strong> folder. It now means you browse to that folder and upload the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">cyber security insurance policy</a> or other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">contract document</a> to the client summary asset.</p>
<p>If you navigate to the <strong>/signed contracts</strong> folder and there is no <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">signed contract</a> in there then you have a problem because it means it does not exist. It cuts down on uncertainty when the folder structure is consistent across clients and platforms and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">increases trust significantly</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-5">Completing Microsoft Teams Integration</h4>
<p>I know what you are thinking. &ldquo;<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout"><em>That is way too much work and I do not have time</em></a>&rdquo; That is where we come in, we are experienced in this type of integration and can help you implement in a more time effective manner than undertaking it internally.</p>
<p>The final step with this strategy is to implement a regimen of ongoing staff training to ensure that the high standards implemented are continued into the future.</p>
