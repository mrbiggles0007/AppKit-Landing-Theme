<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our experience working as </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation specialists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support companies in North America, we see the vital role that alerting and notification software plays in ensuring the smooth functioning of business operations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-time monitoring applications provide businesses with insights into their systems, helping to detect and resolve issues before they become major problems. In this article, I will provide an overview of IT support companies and their use of performance monitoring applications, their key features, types, and implementation best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitoring tools are software tools that enable I.T support companies to monitor and manage the IT systems of their clients. With these apps, companies can remotely monitor and manage networks, servers, workstations, and other devices. Monitoring utilities provide businesses with a range of benefits, including improved system uptime, faster issue resolution, and better security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentation tools are an essential part of managing monitoring utilities due to their complex nature. Documentation provides I.T support companies with a detailed overview of the IT systems they are managing, including network topology, hardware and software inventories, and configuration details. With this information, organizations can quickly diagnose and resolve issues, improving the overall efficiency of their operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following sections, I will discuss the key features of monitoring utilities, the different types of network monitoring software, and implementation best practices. I will also give an overview of popular IT monitoring app providers and factors to consider when choosing a monitoring app provider.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TOP TIP: When looking to purchase monitoring software agents (such as Kaseya etc) never settle on the first price given. There is huge competition in this segment now and there are some hungry up and comers who arguably provide a better product than some of the larger </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RMM Vendors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of this article, you will have a comprehensive understanding of system monitoring applications and their importance for businesses in the USA and beyond.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Features of IT Monitoring Applications</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance monitoring applications offer a range of key features that enable I.T support companies to manage and monitor their clients' IT systems effectively. These features include </span><a href="https://www.smbnation.com/community-content/2223-14-aggravating-challenges-msps-face-each-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alerting and notifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, performance monitoring, security monitoring, inventory tracking, and reporting and analytics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alerting and notifications are critical and enable IT support companies to stay informed about issues as they arise. With these features, support companies can set up alerts and notifications for various events, such as system downtime or security breaches, and receive real-time updates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This enables companies to respond quickly to issues and ensure the smooth functioning of their clients' IT systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance monitoring is another essential feature &amp; small part of the overall umbrella of alerting software. This feature allows I.T support companies to monitor the performance of various IT systems, including servers, workstations, and networks. Support companies can track CPU usage, disk space, memory utilization, and other metrics to detect and resolve issues that could impact system performance.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security monitoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also critical for I.T support companies, especially given the increasing number of cyber threats facing businesses today. Monitoring systems offer advanced security features that enable I.T support companies to detect and respond to security breaches quickly. These features include </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security incidents msp - index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intrusion detection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, firewall monitoring, and vulnerability assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventory tracking is yet another feature used as part of a monitoring application. With this feature, I.T support companies can maintain an accurate </span><a href="https://www.scalepad.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inventory of hardware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and software assets, including licenses and warranties. I.T support companies can use this information to manage asset lifecycle, ensure compliance, and optimize software usage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, reporting and analytics features enable I.T support companies to track and analyze system performance over time. These features allow I.T support companies to generate detailed reports and visualizations that provide insights into IT system health and usage trends. I.T support companies can use this information to make data-driven decisions about IT system management and optimization.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of Monitoring Systems</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance monitoring applications come in various types, including agent-based monitoring, agentless monitoring, and hybrid monitoring.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent-based monitoring&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involves deploying </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitoring_and_surveillance_agents"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitoring agents on devices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and systems. These agents collect data on system performance and transmit it to the monitoring app for analysis. Agent-based monitoring is suitable for managing systems that are always online and connected to the network.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agentless monitoring</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does not require agents to be installed on devices and systems. Instead, it relies on protocols such as SNMP and WMI to collect data on system performance. Agentless monitoring is suitable for managing systems that are not always online or connected to the network. Most agent based applications (Kaseya, Connectwise &amp; Atera for example) have an agentless component in the form of SNMP.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hybrid monitoring&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combines agent-based and agentless monitoring approaches. With this approach, I.T support companies can leverage the benefits of both types of monitoring to manage a variety of IT systems effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly all applications used by I.T support companies fit into this category. In most cases, workstation agents will be deployed on every desktop and even mobile devices (Agent Based) These agents will report back either directly to the application or in some cases will report back to a server agent on their network segment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is common for servers to have a collector installed that collects all of the SNMP traffic from their local network and feed it through to the application (Agentless/Hybrid)</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Real Time Monitoring Applications</span></h3>
<p><strong>TOP TIP</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> monitoring applications exist and could be a viable option although they do tend to work for either side of the experience spectrum. If you are just </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">starting your own IT services company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and lack the cash to invest then open source tools can be a great help. Sometimes it is good to start with a limited set of remote tools so that when the time is right and you can afford commercial grade monitoring software then you will appreciate the benefits they bring.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, at the other end of the scale, you may have dedicated </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-house expertise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is able to get the most out of open source solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the majority of us though, time is money &amp; it is cheaper to purchase off the shelf monitoring management software than it is to hire experts or learn it ourselves.</span></p>
