<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General purpose apps used by </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp open source apps-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT support outsourcing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies are a set of tools and software used by service organizations to manage and monitor clients' IT systems. Our experience has given us a strong understanding of the benefits and challenges of these applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The articles here specifically relate to </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used by IT service organizations that do not fall into any of the other specialist categories below. These links will take you directly to other topics that relate to specialized applications used by IT support partnerships:</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service management applications consist of several key tools and software that go beyond the list above, including </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp monitoring apps-index-page"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote Monitoring and Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (RMM), Professional Services Automation (PSA), Backup and Disaster Recovery (BDR), Antivirus (AV), and Patch Management. These tools allow them to efficiently manage and monitor their clients' IT systems, increase productivity, enhance security, and provide better customer service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the core of these versatile applications used by IT support partnerships is the RMM tool, which allows support organizations to remotely monitor and manage clients' IT systems. PSA software is also critical to the successful implementation of managed services operational software, providing a comprehensive set of tools for service desk management, ticketing, time tracking, and invoicing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed backup solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are another essential tool, allowing IT support partnerships to back up and recover data in the event of a disaster or system failure for both themselves and their clients. AV and Patch Management tools help tech assistance alliances keep clients' systems up-to-date and secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our experience has also demonstrated the benefits of productivity tools for businesses in the United States. These applications allow businesses to focus on their core competencies while outsourcing IT management to technical support partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT partnerships provide cost savings, improved security, enhanced customer service, and increased efficiency and productivity. Tech support productivity tools also enable technology services organizations to provide clients with valuable managed services documentation, allowing businesses to maintain accurate and up-to-date records of their IT systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT partnership productivity tools present challenges, including </span><a href="https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/top-cyber-security-threats/#:~:text=The National Security Agency has,lack of multi%2Dfactor authentication."><span style="font-weight: 400;">cybersecurity threats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the complexity of tools and software, and the need for ongoing training and education for technical support partnership staff. Additionally, IT partnerships must focus on client retention, ensuring that their clients remain satisfied with the services provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a provider of documentation services to service organizations, we have gained significant experience in many of the class leading apps and we go into a little more detail below on some of the applications we consider the best. While the business practices of some of the class leaders is concerning they do tend to have better budgets and more expertise.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would have said in the past that Connectwise PSA &amp; their RMM tool (Formerly Labtech) were worth the premium alone just to be able to access the years of useful information on their forums however someone had a stroke of genius and decided to remove all of that amazing content and start a new forum which I have to say is shallow and about as useful as a one armed paper boy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember the days when </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arniebellini/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arnie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> himself would deliver the classroom based courses &amp; if you had an issue with support there was always the option of letting him know directly to ensure problems were solved.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have found that simple problems these days are solved quite fast however more complex issues do not get solved in reasonable time frames any more and the personal touch has been lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the core of common apps tech organizations use to support their clients is the RMM tool, which allows organizations to remotely monitor and manage clients' IT systems. RMM tools enable computer support partnerships to detect and resolve issues proactively, often before the client is even aware of the problem. RMM tools can also automate routine maintenance tasks, such as software updates and patch management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our results have shown that RMM tools are critical to the success of computer support partnerships in the USA. RMM tools enable technical support partnerships to provide their clients with superior service and support, leading to increased customer satisfaction and retention. Additionally, RMM tools allow computer support partnerships to work more efficiently, providing cost savings and increased profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take note of the recommendations below in that it is not clear cut. There are features of each that others do not have or do a better job than others. I was surprised at both Atera and N-Able having owned both CW Automate and Kaseya VSA at various points and expecting them to be options only the poor people could afford. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I was starting my own MSP again now and given the price differences, I would likely select these options over Kaseya or Connectwise even though technically they are not quite on the same level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our recommendations of the RMM tools we have used in order of preference are the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.connectwise.com/en-au/platform/unified-management/automate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connectwise Automate</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.kaseya.com/products/vsa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaseya VSA</span></a></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.n-able.com/products/n-central-rmm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">N-Able</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional Services Automation (PSA)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSA software is another essential tool for IT consultancy partnerships. PSA software provides a comprehensive set of tools for service desk management, ticketing, time tracking, and invoicing. PSA software enables IT consultancy partnerships to automate many of the routine administrative tasks associated with IT management, freeing up staff to focus on higher-value activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSA software provides a single, integrated platform for managing clients' IT systems, allowing IT consultancy partnerships to provide superior service and support. Additionally, PSA software can help IT consultancy partnerships to streamline their operations, providing cost savings and increased profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our recommendations of the PSA tools we have used in order of preference are the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.connectwise.com/en-au/platform/business-management/psa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connectwise Manage</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://halopsa.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HaloPSA</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.freshworks.com/freshdesk/?_gl=1*1n1ik20*_gcl_au*MTQ1MzMxNTM2Mi4xNjg2NTQxODEz*_ga*MzY0ODkxNjU0LjE2ODY1NDE4MTQ.*_ga_7W0V9DD6X9*MTY4NjU0MTgxMy4xLjAuMTY4NjU0MTgxMy42MC4wLjA."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshdesk</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.kaseya.com/products/bms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaseya BMS (If using Kaseya VSA)</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backup and Disaster Recovery (BDR)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BDR is another critical tool in the tech assistance alliance productivity tools suite. BDR tools allow technical support organizations to back up and recover data in the event of a disaster or system failure. BDR tools enable IT consultancy partnerships to ensure that their clients' data is protected, even in the face of unexpected events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our results have shown that BDR tools are essential for technology services organizations in the USA. BDR tools provide peace of mind for clients, knowing that their data is protected and can be recovered in the event of a disaster. Additionally, BDR tools can help technical support partnerships to differentiate themselves from their competitors, providing a unique selling proposition that can lead to increased business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our recommendations of the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BDR tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including hardware &amp; OS we have used in order of preference are the following:</span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/oracle zero data loss recovery appliance vs acronis cyber appliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acronis cyber appliance</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/freenas vs truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreeNAS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antivirus (AV)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AV tools are critical to the security of clients' IT systems. AV tools protect against malware, viruses, and other security threats that can compromise data and system integrity. AV tools can also provide alerts when potential security threats are detected, allowing technology services organizations to take action proactively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our experience suggests that AV tools are essential for tech assistance alliances in the USA. AV tools enable technical support orgs to provide a high level of security for their clients' IT systems, protecting against potential data breaches and other security threats. Additionally, AV tools can help technology services organizations to comply with industry-specific regulations, such as HIPAA and PCI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our organization steers away from really cumbersome solutions that seem to turn even the most powerful machine into a slug. Norton comes to mind as does Mcafee. In actual fact there is a lot to be said for running Windows defender (built in Microsoft) on the workstations these days as we have found it up to the task. Of course workstation protection is only one part of the equation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our recommendations of the security tools we have used in order of preference are the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/comprehensive-security"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows Defender</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.huntress.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huntress</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://arcticwolf.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arctic Wolf</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowdstrike</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proofpoint</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patch Management</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patch management tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enable technology services organizations to keep their clients' IT systems up-to-date and secure. This pretty much overlaps with RMM tools above but it still deserves its own section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patch management tools automate the process of applying updates and security patches to software and operating systems, ensuring that clients' systems are protected against the latest security threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patch management tools enable tech assistance alliances to provide a high level of security for their clients' IT systems, protecting against potential data breaches and other security threats. Additionally, patch management tools can help technology services organizations to comply with industry-specific regulations, such as HIPAA and PCI.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros and Cons of Productivity Software</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While general productivity tools offer several benefits, they also come with certain challenges. Here's a closer look at the pros and cons of using general applications such as service desk software:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros</span></h3>

Additionally, managing multiple clients can be challenging and requires careful planning and organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through our experience in providing document collaboration services to computer service companies, we have seen the benefits of having proper </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT support documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By maintaining comprehensive records of client systems and procedures, IT consultancy partnerships can ensure that their clients receive consistent service and support, regardless of which team member is handling their account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT consultancies play a crucial role in managing and maintaining the IT infrastructure of businesses in the US. By utilizing the latest software and hardware tools, service providers can deliver cost-effective and efficient solutions to their clients.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is essential to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and security threats to ensure that clients' systems are adequately protected. And, by maintaining proper documentation, tech support organizations can ensure that their clients receive consistent and reliable support.</span></p>
