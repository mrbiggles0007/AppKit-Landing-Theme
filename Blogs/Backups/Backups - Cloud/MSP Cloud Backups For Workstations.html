<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desktop PC image backups online are the topic of this discussion and we will be discussing the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud backup vendors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with offerings that most satisfy this task. Factors that are unique to workstation cloud backups such as data selection, when and how the backups should occur so as not to interrupt the workstation user will also be discussed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a secondary goal of the main discussion of backing up workstations to the cloud, I will also discuss how documentation can help IT consulting services manage and maintain backup and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data recovery solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effectively as it specifically relates to this topic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a near infinite number of sites discussing every subject to do with being a service provider except how your documentation strategy affects those same topics. All of my articles focus on the primary topic at hand and how it relates to MSP documentation if deemed appropriate and let's face it, it's always appropriate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A squared away documentation strategy can help you respond faster to your clients needs, allow less experienced staff handle tasks they otherwise could not and ultimately improve your profit margins while getting ahead of your competition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be general backup advice discussed here or the steps involved on how your help desk staff undertake your </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client backup verification process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clients backup verification process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It enables IT service advisors to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their clients effectively. Chances are that the company that consistently outperforms you in areas such as ticket completion times and number of tickets resolved in a day are likely doing it not because they are better than you but because they have an effective documentation strategy in place.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workstation Cloud Backups Worthwhile?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I am not here to advise what is right or wrong&hellip;but backing up workstations to the cloud is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In almost all circumstances, the decision to backup a workstation to the cloud has to be seen as an unpredictable, unmitigated </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expensive disaster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> waiting to happen except for maybe individuals or extremely small offices of say less than 3 staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a client is asking you to start backing up their workstations to the cloud, then perhaps take my strategy in this situation and laugh out loud as if someone has said something absurdly funny, pretend you never heard it or instigate a medical episode so as to draw attention away from the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My reason for being against backing up desktops to the cloud is that there are far better ways to manage the situation and likely far </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less costly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am assuming you are here because you are a service provider and likely do not have too many small clients. If that is the case then desktop backups are solved by purchasing a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheap NAS device</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creating one or more network drives and educating staff to save all of their work to the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/nas vs san"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Network storage device</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onedrive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or similar application takes care of backing up the desktop and user folder so what is left?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">important industry applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that store their data in weird locations? In nearly all situations you can either move that location to be on the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/freenas vs truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shared NAS device</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or somewhere that is covered by Onedrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leaves the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">desktop operating system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and applications installed. That is when charging the client to create a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rugged computers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">computer image</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with all of the required applications and all Windows updates installed to that point placed on the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shared network storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that it can be easily accessed and the workstation and any other workstation that client has can be easily rebuilt within minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This now makes the unpredictability of backing up </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rackmount computers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">client workstations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the cloud a redundant exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt there are scenarios that I have not considered and there are no doubt valid reasons to continue with your quest so I have compiled a number of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vendor options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for online desktop backups to select from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My strong advice for service providers is to give your clients a link directly to one of the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup vendors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> below and keep them separate from your primary offering and charge time and materials to set it up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comet Backup for Desktop</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cometbackup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is listed at the top of the list because there is not really any reason to look further. Sure I may be a bit biased as it is probably the one I have the most experience with but it's a great little bit of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may seem odd but one of the things I most like about Comet is the </span><a href="https://cometbackup.com/pricing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pricing page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where it is set up like a buffet. You select the base price and the features you want including </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-applications-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disk image based backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example and keeping it at the same level as the others here the price comes out at about $11 per month and includes 5TB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike iDrive below which on the surface appears to offer far more value, the internet is not littered with complaints. On the contrary, reviews from billing to technical support are all glowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">iDrive for Desktop Backup</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.idrive.com/pricing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iDrive Personal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you the ability to create multiple backup users, </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/barracuda backup appliance vs network attached storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup multiple computers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Up to 5TB)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not only more cost effective than some of the others, it can actually create an image of your workstation operating system and have that backed up to the cloud which apart from Comet none of the others mentioned can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that it includes in the price the ability to </span><a href="https://www.idrive.com/idrive-express"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a backup disk once per year at no extra charge while most of the other alternatives either charge $80 or do not provide this service at all.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minus 5 points though for making it look like the express restore is included free as part of the service when it's actually an extra $100.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also provides an optional recovery service where it will post out an external USB hard disk if you have vast amounts of information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works out to be about $70 per year and is advertised as unlimited storage..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware that there are some complaints online about billing issues where if they cannot bill your credit card then they will immediately delete all of your backups before you have a chance to rectify the situation as well as enough poor reviews about reliability that I need to mention it here.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BackBlaze for Desktop Backup</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.backblaze.com/best-online-backup-service.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backblaze personal backup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is cheap and cheerful, has very few features but it does have a good reputation for reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It does not backup your OS files, does not create a disk image, it is a straight file only backup solution so if you want to backup your desktop OS then this will not satisfy your requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also provides an optional recovery service where it will post out an external USB hard disk if you have vast amounts of information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works out to be about $70 per year and is advertised as unlimited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbonite Personal for Desktop Backup</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.carbonite.com/personal/backup/#priceplans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbonite personal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another relatively cheap option with a good reputation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It does not backup your OS files, is for a single PC OR attached Hard disk, does not create a disk image, it is a straight file only backup solution so if you want to backup your desktop OS then this will not satisfy your requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works out to be about $90 per year and is advertised as unlimited.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verdict</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are my pick for undertaking workstation backups directly to the cloud. Comet backup is by far and away the winner here. They have a reliable product, </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good technical support staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and have a good reputation amongst service providers both at this level as well as the more advanced cloud backup solutions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All desktop cloud backup options mentioned here are worthwhile solutions for anyone looking to invest in a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget cloud backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a single or perhaps a couple of desktops.
