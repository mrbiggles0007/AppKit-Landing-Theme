<p>Managing client backups is the topic of today's article. Quite an expansive topic and could go one of a number of ways. I am going to keep it high level at the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup strategy level</a> and will attempt to make it useful for those who may have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">just started their own MSP</a> all the way to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">experienced backup solution providers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index">Backup solutions</a> regardless as to if they are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">hybrid backup strategy</a> which is my personal favorite, an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/quantum dxi-series backup appliances vs commvault hyperscale appliance">all in one backup appliance</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud disaster recovery</a> or the trusty <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">reliable NAS box</a> keeping the receptionists feet warm, have one thing in common, they all carry <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">significant risk</a> that can only ever be minimized rather than eliminated.</p>
<p><strong><em>While you are here, take a look at some of our other </em></strong><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01"><strong><em>backup-centric materials</em></strong></a><strong><em> below that may interest you:</em></strong></p>

</ul>
<p>I will also discuss how documentation can help IT consulting services manage client backups effectively as it specifically relates to this topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">Technical content creation</a> is also an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be client backup management discussed here or the steps involved in setting up an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/truenas vs openfiler community edition">Openfiler community edition NAS drive</a> so that others can fault-find it in a time effective fashion. It enables I.T outsourcing partners to manage and maintain the I.T infrastructure of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup clients overview">backup clients</a> effectively.</p>
<p>We have years of experience in working with service providers to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">document their processes</a> and procedures and there is no area more important to a service provider than how the managed backups of their clients are documented.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Managing Client Backups - Simplicity</h2>
<p>The most important factor in managing client backup offerings is the simplicity of the framework you spend time putting in place. Ever watch those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay%27s_Kitchen_Nightmares">Ramsay kitchen nightmares</a> and notice a pattern developing?</p>
<p>Without fail, he visits a new kitchen and apart from the disgusting state of the kitchens, the biggest issue of which all other issues stem from is the complexity of the enormous menu.</p>
<p>Managed client backups are exactly the same as food except not as tasty. You absolutely need to spend time developing a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backup based framework</a> with which all clients fit into. This makes it easier for your help desk support people because they only need one guidebook on how to set each client up.</p>
<p>Build your base, that is your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XamC7-Pt8N0">fortress of solitude</a>, you know how it works, your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">technicians</a> know it like the back of their hand. Then you bolt on the extras that allow you to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">scale your backup solution</a> while lowering your risk.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Backup Addons Lower Your Risk</h2>
<p>Take a look at the article where I talk about how important it is to always offer extra backup features such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liability waiver when client declines msp backup recommendation">scheduled backup test restores</a> (article) to reduce your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">legal risk</a> when something goes wrong.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">2 Pronged Backup Attack</h2>
<h4 class="display-4">Prong 1 - Cloud Based Backup</h4>
<p>I do not mean having multiple vendors replicating a task when I advise having 2 completely separate components. Unlike when I began a one person MSP in the dark ages, effective and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">reliable cloud backup solutions</a> are easily accessible.</p>
<p>My own experience may cause some bias here however I used to prefer having complete separation between my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/msp cloud backups for workstations">online backup segment</a> of the backup with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">local backup component</a> and that includes the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">backup application vendors</a> as well.</p>
<p>So personally, I would not use someone like <a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-sg/promotion/backup/sem-split/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=MF-X-X-Mixed-APJMea-ANZ-EN-Ecom-EndUserSEMb-AcronisGen-G-PS&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5f2lBhCkARIsAHeTvlhRILYtC4ofKyTDhiWK81-FxUrVZPDlM_GKGILrgNGWt7JVa-K6ywMaAnFqEALw_wcB">Acronis</a> that has an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index">integrated local backup component</a> as part of its <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud offering</a>. This is because if one backup component fails and you are experiencing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">poor support response times</a>, you can take comfort that the other backup component is still running and can be relied upon.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Prong 2 - Local Based Backup</h4>
<p>We are getting to the point now where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">internet link capacities</a> are large enough and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives">cost of data storage</a> has dropped enough that it is conceivable that you can <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas-index">replicate</a> your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas">local incremental image based backup</a> data straight up to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for msps">cloud based location</a> either using your own storage such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS S3</a> or utilizing the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">backup application vendors storage</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TOP TIP:</strong> Recommend always using your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/are storage area networks dead">own data storage</a> rather than the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-applications-index">3rd party backup application vendors</a> included storage. The extra steps involved in setup are worth the peace of mind if your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">application vendor</a> goes rogue.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Cyber Security Insurance Package</h2>
<p>I have been doing my best trying to appear knowledgeable with insurance but I recommend contacting an MSP insurance expert like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JosephBrunsman/videos">Joseph Brunsmen</a> for expert advice in this area.</p>
<p>He has an excellent name among the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/">MSP community</a> in North America and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7reZYdTmjhs">videos</a> are packed with useful information.</p>
<p>My advice on the subject is that you absolutely need this type of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">technology based insurance</a> if you offer backup management related services for your clients.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Managing Client Backups and Your Limitations</h2>
<p>As service providers we offer a highly complex range of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">business technology services</a> and if you stop and think for too long about every conceivable combination of events that could occur across all of those offerings especially when it comes to managing client backups, you probably would not get out of bed in the morning.</p>
<p>It is important when managing backups for other businesses to understand your limitations. Acting as if you are capable of anything and everything can get you into trouble very quickly.</p>
<p>I have never met an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">MSP staff member</a> that I would consider to be a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/mssp overview">security expert</a> or a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">ransomware incident management expert</a>. I am sure they exist with some of the larger service providers however they earn far more than most can afford and that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">narrow level of expertise</a> is hopefully not yet a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">full time job</a> for most providers.</p>
<p>If you experience a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">ransomware incident</a> or a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">client based data breach</a> which may have compromised the integrity of the backups you are providing, stop what you are doing, contact your insurance person and advise them immediately.</p>
<p>Old mate Kev who has an MCSE in NT 4.0 and has been a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">level 2 tech</a> for the last 30 years is probably going to cause far more damage in that situation than doing the right thing and downing tools until you call <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeoMuK536C8">Mr Wolf</a> who can handle the situation.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Managing your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">clients' backup ecosystem</a> is a matter of keeping it as simple as possible for them, yourself, and your technicians. It allows faster lead time to getting <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">help desk staff trained</a> up on common procedures such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/testing client backups &amp; restores">onboarding backup solutions</a> as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">backup offboarding</a> when required.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">Simple backup solutions</a> are cheaper in the long term but that does not mean you should skimp on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">quality of the backup application provider</a> or the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network attached storage">backup hardware used</a>. Use the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">class leading tools</a> where possible because they have a bigger user base and better support with the exception of private equity owned <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">mega vendors</a> who are not interested in the quality of their product.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">2 pronged backup solution</a> with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index">local backup</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">online component</a> and ensure they are both separate from each other. Ideally and if funds permit, try and ensure the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/is cloud storage a viable alternative to nas storage">information backed up</a> is identical in both locations so that they essentially become redundant of each other. If one goes down and god forbid you cannot recover any information, the backup left is not deficient in its features.</p>
<p>Example is ensuring server based images are available both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index">locally</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">online</a> rather than just having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas/backups as a service">data backed up to the cloud</a>.</p>
