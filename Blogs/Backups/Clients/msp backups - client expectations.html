<p>Client expectations about managed service provider backups will be the focus of today's article. Where does the miscommunication between <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">smart technical people</a> and equally (sometimes) <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">smart clients</a> go so very wrong?</p>
<p>I will also list a few suggestions that may help avoid that awful feeling you get when you have that sudden realization that your client has an expectation that your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">premium backup solution</a> is going to deliver on something that it is not capable of.</p>

<p>I will be weaving some wisdom on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">technical material production</a> into the very fabric of this discussion as and when it is appropriate and let's face it, talking <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">technical documentation practices</a> is always appropriate here.</p>
<p>So get strapped into that favorite chair of yours as we navigate a valuable range of talking points on client expectations that will help you instill the correct set of client expectations for your selected backup and recovery solution.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">Structured content development</a> is an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be setting appropriate client expectations on your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">best cloud backup package</a> or the steps involved on how to set up a new client on your backups as a service solution so that your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">trained employees</a> can fault-find in a time effective fashion. It enables <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">IT hardware and desktop services</a> to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their clients effectively.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Technical Staff Communication Skills</h2>
<p>It has been my experience that the more training and experience a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">technical employee</a> gains over their working life, the more likely they are to believe everyone around them are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">deficient in basic intelligence</a>. They do not comprehend that thinking this way is actually demonstrating a deficiency in their abilities.</p>
<p>My advice is whenever you notice a group of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">technical staff start to become critical</a> of another person's ability to do something technical related, you nip the behavior in the bud as it is cancerous to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">support desk</a>. Remind them that their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">job is to help people</a> and the very reason they are being employed is that they know more than the people they are helping.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">Pointing out how dumb someone is</a> that is indirectly paying your wage should be a behavior that needs to be discouraged. This is not only when it is aimed at clients but between <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">levels of support staff</a>. The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">best employees</a> will always attempt to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership">lift those below them</a> up to their level rather than make them feel dumb because they do not know something a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">senior tech</a> believes is common knowledge.</p>
<p>So many <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">support desk environments</a> I have seen tend to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">allow toxic behavior</a> like this to carry on without issue. Fostering an environment that focuses on helping rather than blaming makes a massive difference and yet requires very little effort if practiced early on.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Client Expectations Starts With Documentation</h2>
<p>If it moves then document it, if it doesn’t then kick it then document it. Client expectations of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backups</a> starts with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">good sales documentation</a> backed up by equally clear <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">contractual and technical documentation</a>.</p>
<p>It is intuitive to allocate <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">senior technical support staff</a> to help sales write the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">sales brochure</a> and then allow them autonomy over creating the rest of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups">backup documentation</a> for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">support desk</a> to follow.</p>
<p>My view is that this is an absolutely <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">disastrous strategy</a> to take and I speak from experience. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">Senior techs</a> tend to believe that everyone around them knows what they know or at least a large part of what they know and this distortion of reality causes them to be the single <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">worst type of person to write documentation</a> for others who are less qualified or experienced.</p>
<p>My experience is that give it a week or two and senior techs cannot even follow their own documentation let alone others being able to follow it.</p>
<p>I found that if you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">train staff in your documentation format</a> and give them detailed instructions on how to present technical documentation then the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">best staff</a> to carry out this process are those with between 2 and 4 years of experience.</p>
<p>They will not skip steps, give excuses on why they do not use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">screen shots</a> and have their focus split on 3 other areas. Yes they may have done the process a dozen times and know exactly what to do without a help guide but that is the very reason they should not be allowed in charge of writing documentation, they will assume too much and you will end up with a how to guide that should have 100 steps that ends up with 7 and will be as useful as pockets on a singlet.</p>
<p>A technician that is unfamiliar with the process being documented is more likely to capture far more steps and be more willing to impress with quality work.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Clients That Think It Is Always Your Fault?</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why a client will blame you for backup problems as well as general service desk issues and they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client has legitimate concerns that are caused by you that can be improved upon.</li>
<li>The client has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">legitimate concerns</a> that are caused by you that cannot be improved upon.</li>
<li>The client <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">consistently complains about issues</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">unfairly blames you</a>.</li>
<li>The client sees no problems and determines you are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">charging too much</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to try and impartially attempt to understand which one of the above scenarios is relevant to your situation.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Legitimate Concerns - Can Be Improved</h4>
<p>The first point could be due to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">help desk being understaffed</a>, tickets being unreasonably delayed because of the workload or perhaps the client has a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">poor network setup</a> that creates <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">ongoing technical support tickets</a> where you have not proposed a solution to the ongoing issues mentioned.</p>
<p>This one can be like losing body fat, it is the easiest and hardest thing in the world to do. You may know you need to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">increase staff numbers</a>, invest in better <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">help desk software</a> or get <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">more experienced staff</a>, however if you do not have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">cash flow</a> to facilitate this then knowing may be the easy part, it's the doing that is the hard part.</p>
<p>Communication with the client here to set their expectations is key. You either need to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">raise your prices</a> coupled with nailing down exactly what <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">backup services</a> are being provided. I talk in more depth about the bad habit of providing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/monitoring backups for non agreement clients">free backup services</a> to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/monitoring backups for non agreement clients">existing MSP clients here</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Legitimate Concerns - Cannot Be Improved</h4>
<p>As service providers, the services we provide including our <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">top tier backup solutions</a> can be very complex and we often end up relying on a significant number of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">third party backup application providers</a> as an example.</p>
<p>How often have you run into an issue where you spend ages on a backup problem, contact the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/vertical apps-index">3rd party vertical provider</a> only to be told that they are aware of the problem, it is a problem that is regularly seen and they can rectify it when it occurs, however there is no actual fix for this issue? This is an example of a problem that is going to continue to occur and that you have no control over.</p>
<p>The solution to this is to contact your client and discuss the situation with them. Let them know that you have no power to rectify either the frequency of the problem or the length of time it will take to rectify. Ask them how they want to handle the issue.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that you manage your clients expectations otherwise they may lump these particular <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/vertical apps-index">third party issues</a> in with other problems they are having and form the view that you are just not very good at your job.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Everything Is Your Fault</h4>
<p>So I am assuming you have gone out of your way via meetings and other discussions with the client leadership demonstrating in the most reasonable way possible the source of the issues raised and you have determined that the client is being <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/willful_ignorance">willfully ignorant</a>, what do you do?</p>
<p>I want to take this moment to step on any optimism you might have in this situation. If you have communicated to an objectively reasonable standard and you continually notice that the client seems to have a forcefield around them that prevents logical and reasonable communication from penetrating it then nothing you will ever do is going to change them.</p>
<p>Willful ignorance is surprisingly common especially where accountability and extra cost may be the result of understanding the problem at hand. From when I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">started my own MSP</a> right the way to the end, I would estimate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">laws of 80/20</a> were in effect.</p>
<p>I would estimate that the time I have spent either <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">owning an MSP</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">working for an MSP</a>, I have encountered a spectrum of that 20% both with clients as well as people below and above me when working for service providers.</p>
<p>I have never had success in changing anyone that exhibits this type of personality. They will also consume the most amount of your time while paying late and playing mind games. This is assuming you have done your level best to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">explain to the client</a> the situation and you have an otherwise good strike rate in communication skills in general.</p>
<p>A person that has the best intentions and works hard to resolve problems through good communication will never be a match for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">willfully ignorant clients</a>. Eliminate them as soon as you possibly can and I guarantee you that the time saved allowing you to focus on the 80% of great clients will more than make up for the temporary loss of income.</p>
<p><strong>TOP TIP:</strong> If your largest client has this character trait then I strongly advise that you begin chasing new clients so that when the inevitable occurs, you can carry on with minimal disruption.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">No Problems - You Are Charging Too Much</h4>
<p>I liken this to a young plumber who drives half an hour out to a customer and spends 5 hours working on a problem with the dishwasher before handing an invoice over for $550. The customer feels they have their moneys worth and happily pays the bill, no further issues.</p>
<p>The exact same problem and an old experienced plumber turns up and belts the dishwasher with a hammer and fixes the problem within 10 minutes. The client gets a bill for an hours worth of work plus travel time of $150 and hits the roof, rings up the experienced plumber and claims they are being ripped off and will not be paying the invoice (wasting even more of the plumbers time)</p>
<p>He tells the client that its OK he appologizes and will re issue the invoice. Client then receives an itemized invoice of:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 for hammer</li>
<li>$45 for call out fee</li>
<li>$100 knowing where to hit the dishwasher.</li>
</ul>
<p>I bet you know how that would have gone down and yet the experienced plumber saved the client $400 on the identical job. It is the perception of value. The reality is that the experienced plumber saved time for both him and the client because of their experience but that does not matter, it will not matter.</p>
<p>If you are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">great backup service provider</a> then all of your expertise will go into processes and procedures on the front end. Likely if you are taking over from an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">average service provider</a> where their strategy generated more support tickets then the number of service tickets will drop quite quickly which leaves the client asking the age old question "<em>why am I paying you</em>"</p>
<p>This is another communications related problem where you will have to contribute part of your labor towards demonstrating where the value is and trust me, it is harder than you would know. I found the best strategy is to record ticket frequency and times and explain to the client that less is more.</p>
<p>The less number of backup service tickets or general service tickets means huge savings related to downtime for your client. It is important at this point to communicate that any change is likely to result in service tickets going back to where they were with the last provider and asking the client to clarify "<em>Are you actually saying you want us to deliver more downtime for your staff to convey our value to your organization</em>"</p>
<p>This should convince most people that trying to gauge value this way is a very poor metric. Whatever you do, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">do not consider offering discounts</a> at this point.</p>
<p>Turn the tables and explain that because of the efficiency improvements your staff have put in place for your clients staff, you are considering either asking for a bonus or increasing rates to reflect the value being brought to the table. That should help to reduce the demands for freebies for doing a good job although it can result in a lost client, do you want to deal with clients that do not value what sets you apart from the rest?</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Backups and Client Expectations</h2>
<p>With the above points in mind, client expectations as they relate to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/is billing clients to test backups normal">backup and recovery solutions</a> are more complicated than the usual communication issues.</p>
<p>Actually, it is not the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backup expectations</a> that clients have an issue with, they do not care about the backup side of things. Clients will only care about the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/choosing an msp backup solution">restoration component</a>. I realize it is a bit like saying it's not the speed that kills but the sudden stop at the end; however it is also technically true.</p>
<p>I go into more detail on client expectations with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client expectations on enterprise backup solutions">enterprise backup solutions</a> in this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client expectations on enterprise backup solutions">article</a>. In summary though, things like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">incremental backup time frames</a>, differential backups or how <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">local backup solutions</a> are different from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud backup solutions</a> and why both are necessary for good backup coverage can easily confuse <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for generating technical documentation for different audiences (technical vs non-technical)">non technical clients</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Client Expectations And Legal Action</h2>
<p>There is a common saying that expectations lead to more pain than anything else in this world and it tends to make sense. When you sell a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">disaster recovery platform</a> to a client without setting the appropriate level of expectation, their default belief will be that your solution is capable of handling any incident where information needs to be recovered.</p>
<p>We know that there will be situations where the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">data recovery plan</a> will be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">unable to recover client information</a>. The best course of action to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">reduce the risk</a> of being responsible for damages in this particular case is to always have a better backup option available and offered.</p>
<p>If you say to a client “<em>this is what we have, it is the best there is and it is a take it or leave it scenario</em>” and the client agrees to it then finds out 2 years later that they have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">lost information that cannot be recovered</a> resulting in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">serious financial loss</a> then there is a strong chance you will be held responsible for this event.</p>
<p>If however, you had <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">offered extra features</a> that would have avoided the current situation and have evidence that it was offered and declined then the chance of you being held responsible diminishes significantly. Even better is if you can reproduce the signed copy to the client then there is a good chance they will decide not to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">proceed with a legal claim</a> in the first place.</p>
<p>After all, your primary goal is to avoid engaging in any legal action as regardless as to who wins, it is still very expensive to defend yourself in court.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Newsletters And Mailouts</h2>
<p>Newsletters and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">regular professional correspondence</a> detailing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">common backup deficiencies</a> coupled with upgrade paths for clients does two really important things for your business.</p>
<p>It gives an avenue to help <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">improve your clients knowledge</a> on the competence of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup system</a> as well as demonstrating to any judge if it ever gets to that, that you demonstrated a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">consistent effort in keeping your clients informed</a> of news that would help them make good decisions relating to their backups.</p>
<p>Will they read them? You would be surprised, I used to get a majority of my clients reading my monthly newsletter and a reasonable minority of their staff would also read them. Bonus points if you can produce a newsletter that had an article that directly addressed the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">data loss incident</a> the client is taking you to court for.</p>
<p>Even if they do not read them though, it demonstrates you took action to avoid whatever situation the client is now having. Is it a bullet proof fact that is going to win you a case? No, but it is a little element of a well thought out <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">defense against legal attacks</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">avoid legal action</a> so if you can show the client that you wrote about the risk of what they are going through and demonstrated you offered a solution for it, this may prevent them from going through the courts in an attempt to recoup perceived damages.</p>
<p>That is the ideal scenario because once it gets to a judge or jury who think a subnet mask is some sort of nautical based halloween costume and will not pay attention and not really understand what is going on, the outcome could go in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">client's favor</a> no matter how unfair that decision actually is.</p>
<p>Most jurors and judges are going to be indirectly clients of service providers who no doubt will be able to draw on some <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">bad experience</a> or two where the service provider acted badly and so that will also impact any decision. There will be very few instances where someone with your point of view will be judging you.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Cyber Security Insurance</h2>
<p>I make no apology for rabbiting on about <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">good quality technical insurance policies</a>. Spend time up front and invest in a good <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">cyber security insurance</a> plan and if mistakes are made, you have some big guns to back you up.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sales documentation coupled with good contract and technical documentation and having it delivered by someone who is capable of converting complex topics into simple explanations that are still accurate ensures that the clients expectations and the backup product you deliver are at the same level.</p>
<p>I recommend coming up with an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">anti sales brochure</a> listing all of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index">backup management platforms weaknesses</a>. List all relevant frequently asked questions and highlight areas where your backup will not protect the client.</p>
<p>Where there are holes in your backup solution, offer upgrades or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">application add ons</a> that will plug the hole. This is not about making something bulletproof, it is about demonstrating that you offered a solution to a problem and the client said no. This means do not be tempted to just keep adding features to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">primary backup solution</a> thinking that is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Backup options are your safety net in this situation. They show that you offered a solution that would have prevented the current circumstances. I go so far as to say that there should never be a backup system that solves every problem, there should always be a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">backup option</a> specifically designed for the client to say no to.</p>
