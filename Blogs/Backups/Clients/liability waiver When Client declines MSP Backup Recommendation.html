<p>Liability waivers when a client declines your backup recommendation will be the discussion of today's article. We will discuss how useful liability release forms actually are likely to be as well as giving some examples on how a liability waiver fits in with your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/is billing clients to test backups normal">cyber-security insurance policy</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>I will also discuss how documentation can help IT consulting services manage and maintain data recovery solutions effectively as it specifically relates to this topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">Technical record keeping</a> is also an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be liability waivers discussed here or the steps involved on how your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud backup solution</a> is assembled so that others can fault find in a time effective fashion . It enables IT consulting advisors to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their clients effectively.</p>
<p>We have years of experience in working with service providers to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">document their processes</a> and procedures and there is no area more important to a service provider than how their clients' backups and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/inheriting a completely undocumented backup environment">disaster recovery system</a> are documented.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">When To Use Client Liability Waivers</h2>
<p>A client liability waiver or customer release form is used by a service provider when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client refuses recommended backup solution">backup recommendation</a> has been made to the client and they have refused the recommendation.</p>
<p>You would also only tend to use a client liability release form if there was a risk that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client refuses recommended backup solution">client's refusal</a> increases the risk and that they may <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">seek legal damages</a> from the service provider due to not having the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01">implemented recommendation</a> put in place.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Bullet Proof Client Liability Waivers</h2>
<p>They do not exist. As reasonable people we tend to think the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">legal system</a> is also reasonable and say for instance you have had 3 meetings with your client regarding the seriousness of enabling <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">2FA</a> and each time they have said no.</p>
<p>You then give them a backup liability release form that explains the risk involved and they tick the box they understand the extra risk and then sign it, you are in the clear right? Bullet proofed your situation and eliminated any need to worry about that problem anymore right? WRONG!</p>
<p>You could have the best client liability waiver in the world and have it signed in triplicate and all you have done is reduce the risk of being sued by your client if that issue that you raised so many times actually occurs. You may have strengthened it a small amount or a large amount or in some cases due to nuances and complexities in the law that common sense does not reach, it could make things worse.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Legal System Is Incremental In Nature</h2>
<p>It is not like at the movies where one key piece of information is shown and boom, you win and everyone sees that it was the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">shady client</a> trying to shaft you, no, most of the time it will be because a service provider has put in place a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw5pd3O0Y1w">deep defense</a> across multiple layers and not a single piece of paper and one signature.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Your Knowledge Is What Gets You Sued</h2>
<p>Say your client says to you “<em>This password on my computer to login, remove it immediately you savage little peasant and while I am at it, make sure it auto logs in to my Windows 10 and I want my password removed from my phone as well, you have 10 minutes to comply</em>”</p>
<p>No amount of trying to explain to him works so you print off a client waiver form and insist that he signs it. You think that you are now in the clear and are out of a difficult situation.</p>
<p>A month later a suspicious looking character manages to slip past the reception and accesses his <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">open mail client</a> and asks Jenny the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">accounting</a> lady to transfer 50K to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">specified bank account</a> urgently which she does.</p>
<p>A month later you get sued because the client wants compensation because his <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">personal computer</a> was set up to allow anyone to access it. You walk into the courtroom like superman with the client liability release form and present it like it is some type of forcefield.</p>
<p>It may help you depending on what state in the US you are from however it could also be used as toilet paper as well. Ultimately you implemented something that goes against <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">backup industry best practices</a> and likely a number of regulations and you are the expert who knew this.</p>
<p>It is why you had the liability waiver in the first place because you knew it was wrong. So the strength of your client liability waiver could turn out to be wishful thinking.</p>
<p>My analogy is that of a dr, you go in and demand 5 times the dose of a drug that your dr knows full well will be harmful to you. If he whips out a liability waiver and gets you to sign it and you end up with permanent damage, how do you think that will go? If the dr is liable then how come we as service providers should get a free pass?</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Fire The Client?</h2>
<p>It is starting to get to the point now where as a service provider, you need to look very carefully at the clients you bring on and even consider <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">firing poorly performing clients</a>. Sure while you are smaller you may not have much to lose but as your business starts to turn over millions of dollars a year, now you have a lot to lose and all it takes is a frivolous lawsuit or two and you are back working double shifts at Wendy’s</p>
<p>I have plenty of experience with service providers of many sizes and while working on their documentation systems I will be looking for ways to improve profitability for the client and so I alway run the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Manage effective rate report</a> and I will tell you right now, it is nightmare fuel across the board.</p>
<p>You cannot get zero dollars effective rate for a client but I have seen plenty of large clients of service providers bringing in under a $1 per hour effective rate meaning for every hour the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">supportdesk</a> has worked for that client, the service provider has earnt a dollar.</p>
<p>Then you will get a quiet client who gets the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about managed service providers">cheapest service package</a>, maybe a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security applications - index">monthly AV</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">remote monitoring</a> for one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/workstations index">computer</a>, you know the type, unassuming, makes you want to be a better man, likely retired but used to own his own business, paying you $300 a month and I will often find those type of clients with an effective rate over a long period of $150 per hour.</p>
<p>So sometimes the clients that keep you the busiest also keep you the poorest and those clients you neglect, they are sometimes the best and most profitable.</p>
<p>The idea of any lawsuit is not to win it, it is not to be involved in one in the first place because they are very expensive. There are some great tools about now that allow you to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">vet potential clients</a> including the number of times they have been involved in litigation.</p>
<p>As an example, if I found out a potential <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup clients overview">backup client</a> had been involved in initiating 5 lawsuits in 10 years then they would not ever be my client. They may be valid reasons, they may have won every case, it does not matter to me because I would run a mile, in actual fact, the more they won, the faster I would run.</p>
<p>For an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liabilities of hosting client backups">existing backup client</a>, a signed liability waiver may be enough to get them to step back from the brink of taking <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">legal action</a>. Remember we are dealing with human beings here (most of the time) If you can demonstrate that you offered a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">better backup solution</a> that would have prevented the issue at hand and they refused it, chances are it will give them something to think about.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Depth Of Defense</h2>
<p>I look at client liability waivers as a small defense against the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">general risk to my business</a> and not a magic bullet. Definitely use them when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client refuses</a> a recommendation and you intend on keeping the client but understand it is only a small part.</p>
<p>Understand they may not help if they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_law_(United_States)#:~:text=In the United States%2C state,state governments%2C and state courts.">contradict state regulations</a> or best practices.</p>
<p>Your best defense of course is a good <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">cybersecurity insurance policy</a>. An organization much larger than your own can run you into the ground without even needing to win. The cost to litigate will often destroy smaller service providers and even if you win, you still may lose everything.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Client Liability Waivers can be a valuable component of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">total risk minimization strategy</a> for your service provider but it is not a <a href="https://roalddahl.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Ticket">Wonka golden ticket</a> as many believe. Depending on the state you live in and sometimes the state the client lives in, they may mean next to nothing.</p>
<p>It is worth consulting with whoever wrote up your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_service_agreement">MSA</a> as well as your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/is billing clients to test backups normal">insurance broker</a> to ensure whatever liability release you present to the client is not going to break any regulations in your jurisdiction and it will not interfere with the defense strategies that are already in place.</p>
<p>Also utilize other informal defense mechanisms such as regular newsletters and direct mail so that you are both educating your clients on risks they face as well as being seen to be educating your clients on technology risks.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend taking a look at Joseph Brunsman’s YouTube channel as he is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JosephBrunsman/videos">specialist cyber security broker</a> and has a great reputation among other service providers. He knows more about technology insurance than I ever could.</p>
