<p>Trusting a single backup vendor will be today's discussion. There are two ways to look at this issue and both have benefits and drawbacks.</p>
<p>I will discuss situations where there are risks involved in only relying on one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">backup vendor</a> as well as the benefits associated with this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">backup strategy</a>. One tip I want to give up front is when it comes to backup solutions, please make it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM7n0CHSgvY">mandatory for all clients to have their own cybersecurity policy</a> on top of you having your own as the service provider.</p>
<p>I am not an expert but I know enough to know that there are some real advantages to doing this. Many insurers are refusing to insure service providers because they are not profitable anymore. The liability is through the roof and claims are going one way. Even though premiums are exorbitant, believe it or not many insurance companies are running at a loss when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">cybersecurity policies</a> for service providers.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is where you may have integrated your backup or recovery strategy between two backup vendors. An example of this would be say <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Manage PSA</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/oracle zero data loss recovery appliance vs acronis cyber appliance">Acronis Cyber Protect</a> Cloud Integration. So both the advantages and disadvantages of approaching this.</p>
<p><strong><em>While you are here, take a look at some of our other </em></strong><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01"><strong><em>backup resources</em></strong></a><strong><em> below that may interest you:</em></strong></p>

</ul>
<p>As a secondary goal, I will also discuss how documentation can help IT service partners manage and maintain data recovery solutions effectively as it specifically relates to this topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">Technical content management</a> is also an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be backup vendors discussed here or recording the steps involved on how to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/monitoring backups for non agreement clients">monitor client backups for non agreement clients</a> so that others can troubleshoot in a time effective fashion . It enables IT contract services to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their clients effectively.</p>
<p>We have years of experience in working with service providers to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">document their processes</a> and procedures and there is no area more important to a service provider than how their clients' backup and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">disaster recovery systems</a> are documented unless of course your reputation is not important..</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Single Backup Vendor</h2>
<p>The advantage of a single backup vendor is that if there is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/list of high profile backup failures by msps">failing backup system</a> or some strange <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">backup error message</a> appearing then you know exactly which vendor you need to contact to get the problem sorted.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to this is that if you have chosen a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">backup provider</a> with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">poor support reputation</a> and who may take days or even weeks to resolve your issues then you are stuck. It can be incredibly stressful because if you cannot service or verify your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups">clients backups</a> then you are very vulnerable.</p>
<p>Take for example an experience where we had been running a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/msp cloud backups for workstations">cloud backup solution</a> where they prevented us accessing either the admin console or any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">individual client consoles</a>. We had no way of checking if the clients backups were actually functioning. Do you let clients know the moment this occurs? Or do you wait and hope the vendor attempts to fix your problem?</p>
<p>In the situation I mention here, it took a full week to get a solution to the problem and thankfully the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backups</a> had been functioning correctly even though we were unable to verify this. It made for a very stressful few days.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I highly recommend utilizing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/backup appliance vs network attached storage">local network storage devices</a> that work as part of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">basic backup solution</a>. We still had those backups running flawlessly during that time.</p>
<p>It is also the reason I tend to have gone off <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/oracle zero data loss recovery appliance vs acronis cyber appliance">all in one backup appliance</a> devices. If a problem occurs and it could be anything from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">application licensing</a> to a code bug, it is quite conceivable that the problem will take out both your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps">local backup component</a> as well as your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers">cloud based backups</a> meaning the risk would increase significantly.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Multi backup Vendors - Dependence</h2>
<p>So as mentioned above, you may have several <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">software vendors</a> that each complete part of the task required to consider a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">backup successful</a>.</p>
<p>It can work really well if it is done correctly or it can be an absolute <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">backup nightmare</a> if you are dealing with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">poor backup vendors</a>. The main reason for integration is so that your backup seamlessly integrates with your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp application stacks-index-page">PSA software</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">CW Manage</a>.</p>
<p>My experience is that this is an awful idea though. Having 2 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">backup vendors refuse to take accountability</a> for a particular problem and attempt to offload it to the other is a soul destroying exercise and I guarantee it will add significant time to any support desk tickets you attempt to open.</p>
<p>These days there is a much better solution that does not require you to be locked into using the backup software that your PSA requires. <a href="https://www.checkcentral.cc/">CheckCentral</a> has a good name both in software quality and support. It allows a single pane of glass backup management for yourself and your clients. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuO1RyiOYfM&amp;t=4s">YouTube video here</a>. It also comes with a 60 day trial which is actually a useful length of time too.</p>
<p>It allows you to use matching rules to create alerts if <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client backup verification process">backup tasks</a> do not complete within a certain window so you do not have to worry about what is not being alerted on.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Multi Vendor Backups</h2>
<h4 class="display-4">Backup Division</h4>
<p>Some service providers will sometimes attempt to reduce risk by allocating, as an example, half of their clients to one vendor and the other half to another. On the surface this can appear like a reasonable strategy but it really is not.</p>
<p>It adds significant complexity that your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">support desk</a> needs to deal with and while it may halve the risk of a backup affecting 100% of your clients, it actually doubles the risk of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/small business ransomware response">backup incident occurring</a>.</p>
<p>Think of it like this, you have a very important package of 100 grams of vanilla essence that your auntie needs and that you have promised her. She needs the full 100 grams to complete the baking job she has.</p>
<p>You decide to split in half and send it in two packages thinking that it spreads your risk because there is more chance of at least one turning up when in actual fact you have doubled the risk of failure.</p>
<p>It is always better to research and plan up front, select the best provider and use them for all of your clients.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Backup Duplication</h4>
<p>I have seen some service providers duplicate the tasks across <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">two vendors</a> in case there is a problem with one. I cannot state how much of an awful idea this is. Again you are adding excessive complexity into an already complex system.</p>
<p>You are better off investing in a good quality <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable is your msp for a data breach">cybersecurity policy</a> over coming up with complex ways to attempt to reduce your risk.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Backup Components - Separate Vendors</h4>
<p>This is where you spend time up front and research the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/should msps backup google workspace">best online backups vendor</a> and then select ideally a different <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">local backup vendor</a>. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps">Synology hardware</a> for instance comes with a perfectly <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-applications-index">stable imaging application</a> for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index">local backup management</a>.</p>
<p>This is my recommendation and it is due to the experience I have had where support for backup issues was taking a long time. Having that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/moving from a local to offsite msp backup offering">local NAS recovery option</a> really made a big difference.</p>
<p>I mean if you are really concerned while the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud backups</a> are down then you can implement a rotation of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">cheap USB drives</a> and set up the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/synology diskstation vs wd my cloud">Synology NAS drive</a> to image a copy to the USB drive and have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">client staff member</a> take it off site until you are back in business.</p>
<p>If the problem is the other way around then you have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud back ups</a> that can be relied upon until the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-hardware-index">local backup is up</a> and running again.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mixing more than one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">backup vendor</a> can appear to be lowering your risk as a service provider however it absolutely is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>When it comes to many of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">large technology vendors</a>, they are using bots and artificial intelligence more and more in their first line support and if your problem is not an easy one to fix, it becomes very frustrating to get a vendor to take responsibility when another vendor is involved in some way.</p>
<p>Separating the two halves of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup solutions</a> is in my opinion the best way to go and keep the vendors away from each other. Vendor A is local and Vendor B is cloud and that way support will be easier and your support staff will not be duplicating tasks in two slightly different ways.</p>
