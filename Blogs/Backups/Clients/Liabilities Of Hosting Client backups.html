<p>Liabilities of hosting your clients backups will form today's exciting article. Nothing gets me going as much as thinking about the legal and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">financial risk</a> we as service providers take when offering solutions such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">local backup services</a> to clients, does it make me dull? Probably but there you goâ€¦..</p>
<p>I have spoken on this several times in a more narrow focus on particular topics however this is going to approach the liabilities of client backups especially when hosting them yourself. I will look at the risks involved in using your own data storage versus utilizing the storage offered as part of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">commercial cloud application offering</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>While you are here, take a look at some of our other </em></strong><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01"><strong><em>backup-focused articles</em></strong></a><strong><em> below that may interest you:</em></strong></p>

<li><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liability waiver when client declines msp backup recommendation">Are Backup Liability Waivers Useful?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am going to weave some <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">technical documentation</a> wisdom into this article for several reasons, it is one of the few areas I am both proficient in and thoroughly enjoy and because it seems appropriate no matter what the topic is. I mention it so that I may get the opportunity to manage and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">maintain data recovery solutions effectively</a> as it specifically relates to this topic.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">technical publication process</a> is an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be hosting storage solutions discussed here or the steps involved on how to add a new client into your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas/5 tips on backups as a service">Backup as a Service solution</a> so that your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">loyal support desk staff</a> can fault-find in a time effective fashion. It enables <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">IT hardware and support services</a> to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their clients effectively.</p>
<p>We have years of experience in working with service providers to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">document their processes</a> and procedures and there is no area more important to a service provider than how their clients' backup and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">disaster recovery systems</a> are documented.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Vendor Included Storage Solutions</h2>
<p>Using the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives">included storage</a> being offered in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">white label vendor</a> backup solution is as attractive to service providers as fried chicken is to fat men (No judgements)</p>
<p>The reason for that is that when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">backup application</a> comes wrapped in a bow with everything already connected and working together, well what is not to like?</p>
<p>I am going to attempt to convince you not to go down this route especially when it comes to hosting client backups. If the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">backup and recovery vendor</a> goes rogue or even worse goes zero dark thirty, the chances are high that it will be across the board.</p>
<p>You will not only lose access to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">backup application</a> itself but if you chose their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">inclusive storage package</a> then I have some bad news for you, that is probably gone too.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Hosting Client Backups Using Your Storage</h2>
<p>I am not talking about buying a few <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">performance SSD drives</a> and throwing them into a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps">Synology backup unit</a>, I go into detail in another article about the pitfalls of attempting to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">backup to your own office</a>.</p>
<p>I am talking about choosing one of the many <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/msp cloud backups for workstations">cloud backup storage options</a> that exist today from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Azure</a> or even <a href="https://www.egnyte.com/">Egnyte</a> so that you can get meaningful separation between the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">Online backup application</a> and the cloud <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network attached storage">storage network</a> so that in the event of your cloud <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">backup vendor</a> being naughty and absconding to Belize with their customers cash, you can at least access the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">raw backed up data</a>.</p>
<p>This is because they have no control over your data stores. It's a bit like a BYO restaurant, sure it may be a hassle bringing your own bottles but you know the quality of their contents and always have complete control.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Separate Data Hosting and Liabilities</h2>
<p>While this probably holds true for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">Virtual machine hosting</a> as much as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">backup hosting</a> we will concentrate on the hosting of client backups in this article.</p>
<p>There are some horror stories about recently where cloud backup vendors such as <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/03/22/arcserve-storagecraft-operation-has-lost-customer-data/">StorageCraft</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/03/23/online-backup-company-carbonite-loses-customers-data-blames-and-sues-suppliers/">Carbonite</a> and <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2024/07/06/kaseya-spanning-backup-issues/">Kaseya</a> have been experiencing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">corruption of backup data</a> in some way and because they control the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">storage hosting</a> for your backup, they have complete control and your control is limited.</p>
<p>By keeping your data with a separate <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">cloud data storage vendor</a>, you limit the chance of losing both the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-applications-index">cloud backup application functionality</a> as well as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud storage functionality</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">How Does Liability Come Into Hosting Client Backups</h2>
<p>It stands to reason that by lowering your risk by using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">separate vendors</a> for different tasks you lower your risk of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">complete backup solution failure</a> however you also double the risk of there being a smaller issue of 50% or less so that does need to be considered.</p>
<p>The actual process of determining fault and allocating blame is far too complex for the average service provider though. I have no clue if it increases your liability or decreases it. Every time I have tried to understand the way the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">legal system</a> works, I initially walk away thinking I now understand only to find that there has been a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">recent legal result</a> that is the complete opposite to what I was expecting.</p>
<p>That is the long way of saying that you need to have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">cybersecurity insurance broker</a> who actually understands the technicalities and who can advise you when either option goes bad.</p>
<p>What I am saying is you need the best <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">technology insurance cover</a> you can afford so that when you get sued, you can survive the experience and continue afterwards regardless of the outcome.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Liability of an MSP when it comes to hosting clients data and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backups</a> makes calculating a complex <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">subnet mask</a> look like child's play. I have learnt that it makes no difference if a specific event was not your fault, sometimes you will still be held responsible.</p>
<p>With the increasing levels of litigation leveled at service providers and the potential for massive levels of damage that can occur if a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">client backup fails</a>, the only right course of action is to grab that large sweaty wad of cash they are asking for and deliver it to them with a smile.</p>
<p>With that out of the way the next recommendation I have is to ensure that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud backups application vendor</a> be kept as separate from the data storage services as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state_in_the_United_States#:~:text=The first amendment to the US Constitution states %22Congress shall,for the Supreme Court's interpretations">church and state</a> are in the constitution.</p>
