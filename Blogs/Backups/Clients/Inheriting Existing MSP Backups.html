<p>Inheriting an existing backup from an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">outgoing MSP</a> will be the joyous topic of today's article.</p>
<p>I will try and give some pointers based on my experience of this process including ways in which you can avoid tension in what can be a volatile process.</p>
<p>As a secondary goal of the main topic, I will also discuss how documentation can help IT consulting services manage and maintain data recovery solutions effectively as it specifically relates to this topic.</p>
<p><strong><em>While you are here, take a look at some of our other </em></strong><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01"><strong><em>backup resources</em></strong></a><strong><em> below that may interest you:</em></strong></p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">Information architecture and documenting</a> is also an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be the concerns about backup inheritance discussed here or the steps involved on how to set up a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/nas4free vs truenas">Network attached drive using nas4free</a> so that others on your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">help desk</a> can set it up from scratch in a time effective fashion . It enables IT consulting advisors to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their clients effectively.</p>
<p>We have years of experience in working with service providers to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">copy write their processes</a> and procedures and there is no area more important to a service provider than how their clients' backup and disaster recovery systems are documented.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Backup Rollout Planning</h2>
<p>Hopefully you have some experience already in taking over a client that has an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">out-going MSP </a>and lived through some of the issues that crop up.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">Lack of planning</a> is probably one of the biggest causes of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">project failure</a> when it comes to inheriting a backup site. The first step is to have a plan of attack. Sit down and come up with a set of steps that you know you need to execute to successfully put in place the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">new backup solution</a> that your organization is going to provide.</p>
<p>Assuming you already have your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">plan documented</a> in something like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">IT Glue or Hudu</a>, planning should ideally start 1 month prior to takeover. My recommendation is that you do not include <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">onboarding client backup solutions</a> into whatever agreement they have signed on to. This is because there are far too many moving parts and it needs to be treated as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">standalone backup rollout project</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Backup Pricing Conversation</h2>
<p>Clients hate <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">unexpected costs</a>. It is imperative that when signing a new client up to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup strategy</a> that you have a detailed conversation about the costs involved and what is and what is not included in that price. Have them initial each inclusion and sign the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liability waiver when client declines msp backup recommendation">MSA</a>.</p>
<p>I treated the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index">backup agreement</a> as a separate discussion from the Backup onboarding project and kept the costing completely separate. I would make it clear the tasks that we included as well as the tasks that could cause the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">Back up onboarding process</a> to go over our estimates.</p>
<p>I would always clearly state that while our estimation would be X hours, there was no upper limit to the amount of hours that an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">onboarding backup project</a> could take due to the number of variables that were unknown to us.</p>
<p>My strategy was always to estimate as best I could and then double the hours estimated. So if I thought it would take 50 hours then I would estimate 100 hours of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">technical labor</a> to complete the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">onboarding process</a>. This would also require this to be paid as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about managed service providers">block hours in advance</a>.</p>
<p>Any remainder can be put towards out of scope work as part of the backup agreement or even <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01">general managed service agreement</a>. This takes the pressure of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">cash flow</a> out of the equation for you and allows you to focus on the job at hand.</p>
<p>The other benefit here is that if a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">block hour agreement in advance</a> is an issue then it's a strong indicator early on that perhaps you need to re-evaluate if this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">potential client</a> is going to be worth the effort.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Communication With Client</h2>
<p>So you have got the green light and the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp-consulting">signatures on the agreement</a> and everything looks like it is going really well. The client has treated you like some sort of shirtless hero arriving on a horse which is weird because you just met these people but you accept you are awesome and put it down to them being intuitive.</p>
<p>This is not the time to allow flattery to lull you into not getting information on this prospective client. A <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">bad client</a> can quite easily cost you a fortune and leave you with such little resources that your other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">clients will just quietly leave you</a>.</p>
<p>Between sending out the invoice for block time and receiving payment is the perfect time to do some reconnaissance. You should have already asked the client a few questions that help you determine why the relationship with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">previous provider</a> has broken down to the point of parting ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">Changing providers</a> is an expensive evolution. Ask them why they are moving providers. It is a mistake to think that they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">removed the backup provider</a> because of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">technical deficiency</a>. I am yet to meet a service provider that does not think other companies are incompetent and so when a client states it is because of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">technical incompetence</a>, the incoming provider thinks to themselves “<em>Yep, exactly what I suspected, this MSP is run by turtles</em>”</p>
<p>Be very careful of believing the new client here. You want to, it is really seductive to believe that you are the solution to the problems caused by the soon to be exiled and outgoing <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/numpty">numpty</a>.</p>
<p>If a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">new client</a> uses the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">lack of technical competence</a> in the form of “<em>they were useless</em>” but does not give specific instances or examples of how they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">failed technically</a> then that is a serious red flag.</p>
<p>First, most clients do not have the ability to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">measure a technical person's technical ability</a>, that is why they hire service providers, they do not know the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">technical work</a> we do. Would it surprise you to know that nearly all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">client/MSP breakdowns</a> are due to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">personality conflicts</a> and <a href="https://writingexplained.org/idiom-dictionary/familiarity-breeds-contempt">familiarity breeding contempt</a> rather than anything <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">technical related</a>?</p>
<p>Now if they give a number of examples like “<em>We have had 2 instances in 3 months where they were unable to recover important information</em>” then they may have a good reason but remember, you are only getting half of the story.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Communication With Outgoing Backup Provider</h2>
<p>Try and get the chance to talk to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp-consulting">outgoing MSP</a> prior to beginning the project and do this early on. If the client demands you have no contact with them then just explain that contact will be required to facilitate the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups">offboarding process of backups</a>. Take note if they are uncomfortable with this occurring as it is another important piece of information.</p>
<p>None of these behaviors that you witness should be considered proof of anything on their own but when they start adding up, you need to use good judgment here.</p>
<p>If you get to speak with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp-consulting">outgoing MSP</a> and they reply with something along the lines of “<em>We asked them constantly not to save files to the desktops, we undertook training for their staff at our expense because they hire people without appropriate computer knowledge and both of those instances were due to files lost on a desktop we do not believe we were at fault. We offered them a higher level of backup coverage that would include their workstations but they refused the extra cost</em>”</p>
<p>Now you have both sides of the story, who are you siding with? How many times have you had conversations with clients advising them they are taking large risks and put effort into helping them only to have your offer rejected?</p>
<p>Try and speak with both the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">assigned engineers</a> if possible as well as management if at all possible. There were several times after I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">started my own MSP</a> that I would know the outgoing MSP and knew they were a solid operation, sometimes they were more evolved and used better tools than we were using at the time. I was able to have direct access to the owner and the 2 times this occurred, they were guys I respected and trusted.</p>
<p>I was able to get good background information on why the relationship had ended and certainly in one of those cases it stopped us moving forward at all as we found the client had lied through their teeth and owed a substantial amount of money to the provider.</p>
<p>The other situation we did go ahead as there had just been a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">souring of the relationship</a> over time along with a couple of events that could be categorized as bad luck. I overrode my gut feeling with that one and 18 months later certainly regretted that decision.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Communication With Clients Employees</h2>
<p>Often communication with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client refuses recommended backup solution">outgoing backup provider</a> will not be great and this is often due to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">strained relationships</a> between the client and provider so you will be unable to obtain intelligence on the client via that avenue.</p>
<p>The client may have passed the sniff test and given all of the appropriate answers. Door number 3 is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">client's staff</a>. Some discrete poking around and discussions with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">staff</a> can help establish the viability of the future relationship.</p>
<p>Do they tend to blame every problem on technology and the people that maintain it? Do they appear to have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">minimum amount of computer training</a> to hold the position that they do?</p>
<p>Are they friendly and appear to form a cohesive team? Do they seem to absorb the knowledge you are imparting and do they seem to get along with the previous service provider? If they did not get along with them, why not? These are all important points to establish.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">De Escalation Of Tense Situations</h2>
<p>We all have pretty similar work lives in the managed service industry and the sector has matured a lot so there is now a reasonably standard way of handling things. Stop thinking of the outgoing MSP as the enemy. He is your best friend in this situation in most cases.</p>
<p>If you approach them in a conciliatory way and ignore any initial signs of anger and frustration, you will likely find that their willingness to help you exceeds the need to burn their client. You may also get some good inside information such as the reasons why things broke down.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Handling Payment Disputes</h2>
<p>Often when the outgoing MSP is being difficult it is because they have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">not been paid for work</a> they have undertaken and or are expected to interact with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">onboarding team unpaid</a>. I think that would anger most of us.</p>
<p>It is really worth attempting to discuss this situation with the client and attempt to persuade the client to pay any outstanding bills to make it easier to achieve an outcome everyone wants. I realize that is a tall ask.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could approach the MSP and agree to pay them for the offboarding work if you are certain you want to still have this client. It could well be the cheaper option for you to achieve your goals. Of course check with your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">cyber insurance broker</a> to ensure that this will not cause any issues.</p>
<p>Any hint of a potential client refusing payment to an outgoing MSP should be seen as another big concern. I do not know about anyone else but I pay my bills, I do not look for an excuse to get out of paying them and so I personally look down on those sorts of tactics with very few exceptions.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">3rd Party Background Checks</h2>
<p>Finally door number 5. There are plenty of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">third party applications</a> out there that allow you to do <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">background checks</a> on individuals however there are now plenty that will also allow you to investigate companies. You specifically want to look for patterns of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">legal action being taken</a> over time as well as being taken to court for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">non payment of bills</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have access to this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">type of application</a> or you cannot get a history on legal actions they have taken in the past then speak to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">CyberSecurity Insurance broker</a> and the reason I say that is, they will have all manner of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp documentation apps overview">risk assessing tools</a> that may not be available to you.</p>
<p>It is as much in their interest as it is in yours to ensure that you are not about to take on the Charles Manson of the client world with 23 legal actions against providers in 10 years.</p>
<p>They may be able to do a very quick check and inform you if the potential client is a risk or not.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">1 Month From Backup Migration</h2>
<p>Ideally there is a 1 month gap between getting the go ahead and the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">backup project</a> physically beginning. A perfect world hey! Yeah I realize that in most cases it will probably be less than that.</p>
<p>I wanted a month but would settle for a minimum of 2 weeks, any less than that and I would let the client know it was not going to be possible. I never had a client walk away at that point which just goes to show, if you use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">firm communication</a> and act as if, there is unlikely going to be any issues.</p>
<p>The reason I preferred 1 month is because it meant I could send the invoice with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">payment in advance</a> for the 100 hours out immediately and have a 2 week buffer before lifting a finger reducing our risk as the service provider.</p>
<p>I would send the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">invoice</a> out and if it had not been paid in the first week then I would send an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">invoice reminder</a> and follow up with a phone call to get things moving explaining the need for it to be paid to begin the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index">backup onboarding project</a>.</p>
<p>I would wait another week so 2 weeks in total and if it had not been paid I would let them know that it had not been paid and that the project would be pushed out by 2 weeks from the date it was paid.</p>
<p>It was a great way to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">eliminate poor paying clients</a>. Some were legitimate oversites and in most instances that was the case. I had a few that I never heard from again. The beauty of that is I did not waste a single hour of my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">technical staff's time</a> on people that were going to be difficult to get payment from.</p>
<p>Once you whittle that start time down to 2 weeks then you start to get to a point where the actual work for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">onboarding backup project</a> needs to begin and that can overlap with not getting paid. As a service provider you are not taking on the risk because your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">remote tech staff</a> are having to invest hours on setup and the new client does not yet have skin in the game. I was burnt too many times to ever let that happen again.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">Good clients</a> will always make sure they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">pay promptly</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Backup Offboarding Day</h2>
<p>I used to plan the offboarding of a previous backup provider so that it was like an ax falling, minimizing as much as possible the time with which both providers had agents or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/vertical apps-index">third party applications</a> communicating at the same time.</p>
<p>If you plan it right then you should be able to use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">powershell scripting tools</a> via an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">RMM tool</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps are moving to halo psa">Halo remote management</a> to remove <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">old backup agents</a> at the exact same time as each other across all client sites. From that point you are now in control. It was a lot like painting a room, 90% of the work was preparation.</p>
<p>How you plan the timing and what you include in the steps for backup handover exceeds the high level of discussion this article is aimed at but certainly message me if you need a template and I may be able to dig one up.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Inheriting existing MSP backups and or offboarding an ex backup provider is not only a complex task, it also <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">requires good people skills</a> because there are usually hurt feelings and frustration on both sides with yourself in the middle.</p>
<p>The effort spent on overlooking abrasive interactions with both the client and outgoing provider will pay dividends in significantly increasing the chance of a successful backup onboarding project.</p>
<p>Couple that with getting paid up front for the up front work and the chances are quite good that you will end up completing the evolution smoothly.</p>
