<p>There are plenty of examples of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">MSPs</a> not backing up cloud applications! Should we be backing up cloud applications for our clients as well as ourselves will be the discussion I would like to have today.</p>
<p>It really is easy to think that because everything is in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud</a>, it is safe and we do not need to worry about <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backing up any information</a> that is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">cloud service based</a>. We will be investigating if this view is deficient or not.</p>
<p>We will determine if throwing caution to the wind and ignoring the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas/5 tips on backups as a service">3-2-1 backup</a> ethos is an appropriate course of action.</p>

</ul>
<p>I have touched on this subject in other articles above however they go a little more into depth on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">specific cloud based applications</a>.</p>
<p>This will be a general guide as even today there is a pervasive idea that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud based strategies</a> are not required to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">backed up</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">MSPs Do Not Backup Cloud Applications?</h2>
<p>It is easy to understand why this view has persisted even to this day. When <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud computing</a> was introduced into mainstream consciousness in around 2007 from memory, they really were a novelty. My first exposure to cloud computing was with <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>I thought it was great but it gave me mixed feelings of dread and joy although I never had any comprehension of how <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/should we backup cloud apps">successful cloud computing</a> including <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">online backups</a> would end up being.</p>
<p>From there was a slow burn until I attended a conference where they began discussing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">Office 365</a> at a time when I was raking in profits from selling <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Microsoft Office 2010</a>, in actual fact I made more money on that than the computer I was selling it with. I mistakenly believed this was the beginning of the end for all service providers.</p>
<p>Anyway I digress, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/cloud apps-index">cloud based computing</a> did not just suddenly appear and instantly became a standard, no, it has been a gradual uptake over 10+ years. It is hard now to remember a time where its presence was not so dominant.</p>
<p>The stance of most service providers especially at the start was, it's in the cloud so it is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/choosing an msp backup solution">automatically backed up</a> by the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">cloud application provider</a>. To an extent that is true, if you look at <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">O365</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">OneDrive</a>, they have mechanisms in place where revisions are held and reduce the risk of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">losing everything</a>.</p>
<p>However in the time <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">cloud processing and data storage</a> has exploded, so has business dependance on it so it has been easy for providers to get caught out over time and just believe what they always have and that is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas-index">cloud level backups</a> outside of the providers is not required.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">MSPs Should Backup Cloud Applications</h2>
<p>Only if you rely on them of course. I am not going to make any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers">specific cloud backup recommendations</a> here as I detail my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">favorite cloud backup</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">recovery vendors</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/should msps backup google workspace">afi.ai cloud backups</a> in other articles linked at the top and in this paragraph.</p>
<p>The reasons for backing up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">cloud applications</a> are that if you do not and you allow say <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">Microsoft Office 365</a> to run without a third party solution then you are not covering your clients with the industry backup standard of 3-2-1.</p>
<p>To adhere to this standard you need 3 copies of your data with 2 local on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/do tape based backups still have a place today">dissimilar media</a> and at least one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/is offiste backups really needed for msp clients">offsite backup copy</a>.</p>
<p>The confusion arises when people believe that for example your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers">O365 operating copy</a> is also classed as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">offsite cloud backup</a> because it is held off site by a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps">3rd party backup vendor</a>.</p>
<p>You have to look at it from the point of view that Microsoft is the service provider (not yourself) They store the data that you are served however there is no guarantee that they backup that data over a significant period of time or that it is backed up at a site other than where it is accessed from.</p>
<p>Finally, Microsoft actually recommends that you use a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">third party data backup solution</a>. If in future Microsoft starts offering <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">Office 365 backup solutions</a> for their products then I highly recommend avoiding it.</p>
<p>Keeping the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">primary application vendor</a> and the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">secondary backup vendor</a> separate reduces risks if an app <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor</a> ever suffers a massive failure because at least you can then recover the raw data from your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">backup vendor</a>.</p>
<p>If it is the same vendor then the likelihood all systems are compromised goes up significantly.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Reasons to Backup Cloud Applications</h2>
<h4 class="display-4">Data Retention Mismatch</h4>
<p>Your client may need to hold onto data for longer periods than the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">cloud vendor</a> can offer. There may also be gaps in the timeline where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/legal hold and retention policies">data is lost forever</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft and other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">cloud vendors</a> offer dry meatloaf and potatoes with no butter as an analogy, a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">specialist cloud backup solution</a> is like a buffet at the Bellagio, all the trimmings and that is the type of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud backup system</a> you need to service your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups">backup clients needs</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Vindictive Staff</h4>
<p>So your client has decided to buy the cheapest coffee instead of the gourmet stuff they used to get as a cost cutting measure. There are going to be some <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">upset employees</a> who depending on their mental state could be looking for some retribution, some pay back.</p>
<p>They decide to let loose a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/mssp overview">virus</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">start deleting files</a> where they may not be noticed as missing for an extended period or a 100 other ways <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">angry staff</a> can ruin your day, you need to be prepared no matter how unlikely it is.</p>
<p>Your client may not be able to recover that information and oh what's that, you have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">backup agreement</a> with them that assures them this is covered? Prepare to receive a good old fashioned rogering via <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">legal action</a> if that happens.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Integration And Plugins</h4>
<p>Everything works with everything these days. Every time you add a new plugin to help automate <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">password management</a> or allow <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liability waiver when client declines msp backup recommendation">backup alerts</a> to flow through an API directly to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">PSA</a> like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise</a> then it makes it more convenient but it also adds risk.</p>
<p>I have about 7000 Chrome plugins (+/-) and I am the worst at hitting that agree button but everytime I do that, I introduce weakness into my browser, which is exactly the same as integrating backup systems or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/cloud apps-index">cloud applications</a> such as Microsoft 365 or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Skype</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Vendor Service Disruption</h4>
<p>Even the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">biggest tech vendors</a> go dark occasionally and even smaller companies have a hefty hourly running cost, it is not unusual to have a business costing 30K an hour if their staff have to sit around waiting for something to be fixed.</p>
<p>Most specialist cloud <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client expectations on enterprise backup solutions">backup services</a> can be configured to allow almost seamless running of applications. They may not allow for 100% functionality during a down time but they may get to 80% and can also seamlessly transition once the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">primary application vendor</a> is back online. This is important because having to sort through 2 data stores and figure out which is the most updated information is a nightmare if it is something the user has to undertake.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you like living on the edge then by all means, ignore backing up your cloud or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/cloud apps-index">online apps</a>. However most service providers hate how much risk we already have to deal with so prefer eliminating it where possible.</p>
<p>Using Microsoft 365 as an example here because it is the most widely used <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">cloud suite of apps</a>, they provide a great application that does what most office staff need it to and legitimately provide pretty good retention of data. Chances are if a client staff member deletes a file or folder, it can be recovered.</p>
<p>Regardless of that, they are still doing the absolute minimum that they can. They have an application company to run, backing up your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">cloud applications</a> is not part of their core business. Given they recommend that organizations backup Office 365, that is the strongest hint I can think of that makes the case for backing up clients cloud applications.</p>
