<p>Ignoring post ransomware protocols will be my topic for today. I will discuss the risks involved that service providers face when their client or even themselves suffer a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/mssp overview">ransomware security incident</a> and they do not follow the very clear well worn path of not touching anything.</p>
<p>We will look at the risks involved if you ignore this advice as well as why some people still decide to “fix the problem” by, say, running a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security vulnerability overview">virus scanning tool</a> or more likely <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index">recovering from a previous backup</a> thinking this is an absolute guaranteed solution.</p>

<p>As usual, I am going to inject a little documentation wisdom where appropriate and let's face it, it's always appropriate. I will also discuss how documentation can help I.T network administration services manage and maintain <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">information recovery solutions effectively</a> as it specifically relates to this topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">Knowledge management</a> is also an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups">backup procedures</a> discussed here or the steps involved on how to install the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/truenas vs nexenta community edition">community edition of Nexenta</a> so that others can fault find in a time effective fashion. It enables network admin services to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their clients effectively.</p>
<p>We have years of experience in working with service providers to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">write their processes</a> and procedures and there is no area more important to a service provider than how their clients' procedures are documented especially during a ransomware attack.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Mandatory Client Cyber Insurance Policies</h2>
<p>It's getting out of control these days with all the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">legal action and claims</a> being filed against managed services organizations. Service providers, while the cost of their policies are going through the roof and it is easy to think that insurance companies are making a killing from us, it is actually not the case.</p>
<p>Plenty of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/insurers-run-ransomware-cover-losses-mount-2021-11-19/">insurance companies</a> are turning their back on service providers or ramping up the costs and requirements to even get insurance and that is because many of them are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/insurers-run-ransomware-cover-losses-mount-2021-11-19/">running at a loss</a> when it comes to technology related business such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">SaaS providers</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud backup service providers</a>. The claims being made have gone rogue both in number and payout amounts.</p>
<p>One way that you can minimize your risk and appear far more attractive to insurance companies that offer Internet security policies is to make it mandatory for any client that is signing up to any of your technology agreements to have their own <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">information security policy</a>, like hippies trying to use the front door, there should be no exceptions, back door only.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">MSP Cowboys - Not Always</h2>
<p>With the lack of serious regulation in the service provider industry, it is no wonder we have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">choose your own adventure</a>. This is exaserbated because the solutions <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">including backups</a> are complex in nature and the technology that is used changes so rapidly.</p>
<p>So it is not uncommon for a service provider to have started their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">backup managed services organization</a> from their bedroom back in the 90s. No doubt, hard working and conscientious, always trying to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Now pick an exact date where we went from a world that treated technology services companies like an undesirable grouping of nerds trying to convince other organizations that I.T was the way of the future to where we are today where companies cannot run without either <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">outsourced technology providers</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">experienced technical staff</a>.</p>
<p>Not easy is it? A lot of gray between 1990 and 2024 so it is understandable that there are a number of service providers out there who do things a certain way because they have always done them that way.</p>
<p>Reacting to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security stack overview">virus threat</a> or other data loss event is no different. On one side, on hearing of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">lost client data</a>, there is that twisting gut feeling of “<em>gee I hope our backup actually works</em>”</p>
<p>That feeling does not go away no matter how good your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index">backup system</a> is as it is always an uncertainty. The other half is “<em>OK let's get this sorted, I can relax as soon as we recover this data and the client will be happy the faster I get things done</em>”</p>
<p>That way of thinking was OK in the 90s, maybe even up to the early 2000s but somewhere after 2010 that protocol for reacting to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">serious disaster recovery incident</a> went out of fashion. You may be surprised to know that the only provider that would act that way today would have to be categorized as a cowboy.</p>
<p>You are not a cowboy are you? It is Ok if you are and are still doing this as long as you dismount the horse and throw away the spurs after reading this.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">You Just Described My Bulletproof Recovery System</h2>
<p>I get it, wanting to get the client up and running after a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">file server failure</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">virus infection</a> is going to be about your only focus when something happens like this.</p>
<p>So I will give you a scenario that may help convince you that this is not the best course of action and you should ensure all of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">help desk staff</a> have access to the pre ordained steps on what to do during say a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">sudden ransomware incident</a>.</p>
<p>So say for example, you ignore my advice on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/small business ransomware response">post ransomware checklists</a> and rectify the initial problem and get the client back up and running within a short amount of time, then forget all about it.</p>
<p>6 months go by and you get a call from the client, turns out the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/small business ransomware response">ransomware attack</a> you fixed was not just <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/small business ransomware response">ransomware</a>, the underhanded swine behind it are now selling your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">clients data records</a> on the darknet for ten bucks a pop.</p>
<p>The client then explains to you how much more damage having their data stolen is doing than had they just lost all their information and had to start again.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Delayed Knowledge Of Data Theft</h2>
<p>The problem you face when you have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">serious security threat</a> and you try and fix it yourself by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">restoring from a scheduled backup</a> is that you are traipsing through the place like a herd of elephants, destroying evidence as to where the threat came from, how serious the threat is and also make it impossible to determine at that time if <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">data has been stolen</a>.</p>
<p>MSPs have always and will always be the equivalent of the jack of all trades. Sure you get a few <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">level three guys</a> in there who may have undertaken a specialist and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">high level networking course</a> however they are not experts in infiltration by those of low moral fiber, they are not working on serious electronic security incursions day in day out.</p>
<p>We also throw the term <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security services overview">security expert</a> around far too easily. Let's all be honest here, the vast majority of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">service provider technical staff</a> are in no way close to being a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security services overview">security specialist</a> and that includes the people that label themselves as such. At most we use the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security services overview">term security expert</a> as a marketing tool and usually because we have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">security application</a> we have subscribed to.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Expert Forensic Technology Experts</h2>
<p>I have been in IT for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">30 years now</a> and I have yet to meet a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">true security specialist</a>. They are few and far between, make more than most of us could afford to pay and live and breath serious <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security vulnerability overview">damaging Information breaches</a> every working hour.</p>
<p>They more than often work for insurance companies rather than service providers. These are the caliber of people that you need when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security services overview">catastrophic security incident</a> occurs and realistically, the only way we can access that level of expertise is through our insurance.</p>
<p>Make sure your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">Information security insurance policy</a> covers expert advice during security incidents. They should because it benefits them to contain the situation so that it results in the least amount of damage possible.</p>
<p>By leaving it 6 months or a year between the incident occurring to finding out say <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security incidents msp - index">data was stolen</a>, you have taken what could have been a simple phone call to your broker where you can hand off the responsibility to a very real risk of an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">expensive lawsuit</a> because of the unreasonable time between the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">data leak occurring</a> and remediation occurring.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">It's Not Our Fault</h2>
<p>When has that ever mattered? <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">Lawsuits</a> are not about dishing out fairness.</p>
<p>How could you have known that data was stolen at the time of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">confidentiality breach</a>? Well you most likely could not have and that is the whole point.</p>
<p>There is no way with the expertise of the average provider that you are going to be able to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">forensically analyze</a> the clues and determine <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">information theft</a> has occurred which is why it is absolutely imperative to have a plan of action before this happens so that you do not open yourself up to legal action because you were being “helpful”</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Backup and Data Encryption</h2>
<p>If it moves, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">encrypt it</a>, if it does not move, kick it and then<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview"> encrypt it</a>. In many US states, if data is encrypted then a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">data intrusion</a> involving already encrypted information does not count as an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">IT security incident</a>. Take a look at the wording for <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> (European Regulations) for instance where it excludes encrypted data from being considered a data breach.</p>
<p>This is because if it is encrypted then it cannot be viewed or used if stolen. Again I still recommend even in these scenarios, contact your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JosephBrunsman">insurance broker</a>, you are paying for it anyway, you may as well use their advice on these situations because I do not have the expertise to know the strength of encryption required nor the way in which it needs to be implemented for it not to count.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Technology Based Insurance Broker</h2>
<p>Check this article on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">Cyber security</a> where I go into more detail. I know next to nothing about the technicalities of it, all I know is that I need it, you need it, your client needs it and if you do not have it then you are operating outside of what would be considered reasonable in today's marketplace.</p>
<p>Nobody is going to judge you for it as long as you now remedy the situation. If you want more information on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JosephBrunsman/videos">insurance for MSPs</a> then I recommend a guy called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JosephBrunsman/videos">Joseph Brunsman</a> if you are located in the United States.</p>
<p>I do not know him and have never undertaken business with him however he has a really good reputation on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/">MSP subreddit</a> and that is a tough audience to please. His videos demonstrate an expert level of knowledge that is quite obvious.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Stop Everything and Call Your Insurance Specialist</h2>
<p>Assuming you have a broker and policy that allows you to potentially make a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">digital security claim</a> and includes <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">forensic analysis</a> as part of the policy, you need to attempt to lock down and minimize change both from your client and your staff as much as possible.</p>
<p>I cannot reinforce the fact that when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">serious security situation occurs</a>, you do not know the magnitude or the type from ransomware to data theft or even if the data was just looked at, you most likely will not without expert outsider help.</p>
<p>Does that stop you from facing a risk of claim from the client due to loss because of the delay? Absolutely not but it is the lesser of two weevils in most cases.</p>
<p>Remember in Pulp fiction when the wolf turned up and was able to quickly resolve an almost impossible issue. This is the caliber of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">technical expert</a> your insurance company will hopefully have on hand. The other great thing about this process is it is very simple and it transfers the responsibility to the insurance company to analyze the issues.</p>
<p>The alternative is having Big Lez, your favorite <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">second level support staff member</a> playing around just trying to get things working again without attempting to locate evidence that will help paint a picture.</p>
<p>It also means they take the risk of making a mistake, they direct you to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index">restore from backup</a> and that action was a mistake and makes things worse, that is more likely to be on them. If it ever goes to court, it looks a lot better if you are saying “<em>We do not have </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index"><em>in house expertise</em></a><em> to make these decisions so passed it of to our </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys"><em>insurance forensic specialists</em></a>”</p>
<p>That is as close to a bullet proof answer as you will get versus: “<em>We put our best guy Big Lez on the case and he said he will fix it no problems. His MCSE certificate in NT 4.0 as well as having gone on a 3 day bender with John Mcfee in the late 90s gave me complete faith in his abilities, I am not sure how we can be blamed for the cascading number of damages allegedly caused by our best tech, Lesley Mackerel</em>”</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ignoring post ransomware protocols and not having a pre ordained action plan in the form of a guide for all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">technical staff</a> on how to handle a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">major security breach</a> is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>The frequency and amount of incidents has gone through the roof in the last couple of years and along with our <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security resources overview">security response checklist</a> that you have had pre-approved by your insurance broker and a cyber security policy that has a good reputation and has as much coverage as you can afford is the key here.</p>
<p>Most service providers, which probably includes yours, do not have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">internal expertise</a> to manage these incidents.</p>
