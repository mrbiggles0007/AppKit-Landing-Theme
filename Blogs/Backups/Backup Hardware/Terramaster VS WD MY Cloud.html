<h2 class="display-6">Hardware and Software Components</h2>
<p>One of the important factors to consider is the hardware and software components that make up the NAS box. We will be reviewing the entry level two-bay NAS box solutions available from TerraMaster and WD My Cloud in this article.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">TerraMaster F2-210&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.terra-master.com/us/f2-210.html">TerraMaster F2-210</a> is a compact and affordable two-bay NAS box solution that is designed for home and small office use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It comes equipped with a <a href="https://gadgetversus.com/processor/realtek-rtd1296-specs/">Realtek RTD1296 quad-core 1.4GHz processor</a>, 2GB DDR4 RAM (expandable up to 4GB), and two 3.5-inch SATA hard drive bays (supporting up to 16TB of total storage).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also features two Gigabit Ethernet ports, two <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/cables &amp; adapters">USB 3.0 ports</a>, and a built-in hardware transcoding engine that can stream 4K videos.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">WD My Cloud EX2 Ultra&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/products/network-attached-storage/wd-my-cloud-expert-series-ex2-ultra#WDBVBZ0000NCH-NESN">WD My Cloud EX2 Ultra</a> is another two-bay NAS box solution that is designed for home and small office use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is powered by a Marvell ARMADA 385 1.3GHz <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">dual-core processor</a>, 1GB DDR3 RAM (expandable up to 16GB), and two 3.5-inch <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives">SATA hard drive bays</a> (supporting up to 32TB of total storage). It also features <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/cables &amp; adapters">two Gigabit Ethernet ports</a>, two USB 3.0 ports, and supports hardware encryption.</p>
<p>In terms of software, both TerraMaster and WD My Cloud come with their own <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">storage based operating systems</a> that are designed to provide users with a user-friendly interface for managing their NAS box system.</p>
<p>TerraMaster uses the <a href="https://www.terra-master.com/global/tos5">TOS (TerraMaster Operating System)</a> that is based on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">Linux</a> and provides users with a web-based interface for managing their NAS box system. The TOS comes with various features, including support for file sharing, backup and restore, media server, and more.</p>
<p>WD My Cloud, on the other hand, uses the <a href="https://os5.mycloud.com/">My Cloud OS</a> that is based on a customized version of Linux and provides users with a web-based interface for managing their NAS box system. The My Cloud OS comes with various features, including support for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">file sharing</a>, backup and restore, media server, and more.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Ease of Use</h2>
<p>Both TerraMaster and WD My Cloud are designed to be user-friendly, with easy-to-use interfaces that allow users to manage their NAS box systems easily.</p>
<p>TerraMaster's TOS comes with a simple and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">intuitive interface</a> that makes it easy for users to navigate and manage their NAS box system. The TOS also comes with various <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">3rd party tools</a> and applications that make it easy to set up and configure the NAS box system.</p>
<p>WD My Cloud's My Cloud OS is also designed to be user-friendly, with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">simple and intuitive interface</a> that makes it easy for users to navigate and manage their NAS box system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The My Cloud OS also comes with various tools and applications that make it easy to set up and configure the NAS box system.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">NAS Box Enclosure Performance</h2>
<p>When it comes to performance, both TerraMaster and WD My Cloud are very close in this race. However, there are some differences in terms of performance that users should be aware of.</p>
<p>The TerraMaster F2-210 performs well for basic file storage and sharing needs, with read speeds of up to 114 MB/s and write speeds of up to 108 MB/s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it may struggle with more intensive tasks like media streaming or running <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/physical servers index">multiple applications simultaneously</a>.</p>
<p>The WD My Cloud EX2 Ultra offers impressive performance for its price point, with read speeds of up to 117 MB/s and write speeds of up to 112 MB/s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also has a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/mssp overview">built-in hardware encryption engine</a>, which can help ensure the security of your data.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">NAS Box Enclosure Storage Capacity</h2>
<p>While we are only comparing the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/business notebooks &amp; laptops">entry level models</a> here, both WD My Cloud and TerraMaster offer a range of options, from 2-bay devices to larger models with up to 12 bays. It's important to consider not only your current storage needs but also any future growth you anticipate.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a smaller device for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/consumer routers">personal use</a>, the 2-bay options discussed here are suitable for most users. However, if you're a business or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/are storage area networks dead">enterprise backup user</a> with larger storage needs, TerraMaster's larger models may be a better fit.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">NAS box Enclosure Price</h2>
<p>Finally, price is always a consideration when choosing an entry level NAS box device. TerraMasters entry offerings currently come in at around the $300 mark inclusive of 4TB disk space.</p>
<p>TerraMaster F2-210 is priced cheaper at $160 without hard disks so that needs to be taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, WD My Cloud devices are slightly more expensive than TerraMaster devices, but they also offer more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">user-friendly interfaces</a> and a wider range of options. TerraMaster, on the other hand, offers more advanced features and customization options at a lower price point.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both options are good solutions for anyone looking to purchase an entry level network storage device that has reasonable performance where it is unlikely to require expansion during its life time. We hope this article has provided you with a solid foundation and understanding of this topic.</p>
