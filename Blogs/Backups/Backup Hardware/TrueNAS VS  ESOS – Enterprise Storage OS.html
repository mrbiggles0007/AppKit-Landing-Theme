Additionally, being open source means that there is a large community of users and developers that can provide support and assistance.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Support</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS has a large community of users and developers that provide support and assistance. The community is active, and there are various forums and websites where you can get help and advice. Additionally, TrueNAS has a paid support option that provides professional support and assistance.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Cases</span></h3>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small and Medium-sized Businesses</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS is an ideal solution for small and medium-sized businesses that require enterprise-level features but have a limited budget. TrueNAS provides advanced features such as data protection, compression, and deduplication at an affordable cost.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtualization</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS is an excellent solution for virtualization environments. TrueNAS supports various virtualization technologies, such as VMware, Hyper-V, and XenServer. Additionally, TrueNAS supports the iSCSI protocol, which allows you to create virtual disks that can be used by virtual machines.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">File Sharing</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS is an excellent solution for file sharing. TrueNAS supports various file sharing protocols, such as SMB/CIFS, NFS, and AFP. Additionally, TrueNAS provides advanced features such as access control and file locking, which ensure that your data remains secure.</span></p>
