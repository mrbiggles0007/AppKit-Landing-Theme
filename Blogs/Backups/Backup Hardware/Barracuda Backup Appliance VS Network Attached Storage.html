<p>Businesses need to protect their data from loss or damage. One way to do this is by using backup solutions such as the Barracuda Backup Appliance 690 or a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/backup appliance vs network attached storage">Network Attached Storage</a> (NAS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, I will be using the Barracuda backup appliance 690 and comparing it to its capability when compared to a general off the shelf NAS.</p>

<p>I will go through at a high level and highlight the differences between the Barracuda backup appliance 690 and a typical NAS, which are two <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">popular backup solutions</a> used by many businesses today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will provide an overview of each solution, including their features and benefits, and then compare them to help you determine which one is best for your business.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Basics Of the Barracuda backup appliance 690</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.barracuda.com/products/data-protection/backup/models?product=Barracuda%2520Backup">Barracuda Backup Appliance</a> is a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery solution for businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is an all-in-one appliance that combines software, hardware, and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">offsite replication</a> for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">optimal data protection</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Barracuda 690 Hardware Specifications</h4>
<ul>
<li>Up To 12 Terabytes of usable storage</li>
<li>Recommended minimum of 12 Terabytes</li>
<li>1U form factor (rack mounted)</li>
<li>2x10GB <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">RJ-45 network connections</a></li>
<li>4x 10 Terabyte disks for maximum usable storage</li>
<li>Software RAID10</li>
<li>Hot Swappable</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="display-6">Barracuda Backup Appliance 690 - Overview</h2>
<p>The Barracuda backup 690 machine is a complete <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">backup and disaster recovery solution</a> that is designed to protect businesses from data loss and system downtime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 690 appliance is easy to install and manage, and it comes with a range of features that make it a reliable and robust solution for businesses of all sizes.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of the Barracuda backup system is that it provides both local and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">offsite/cloud data backup</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liability waiver when client declines msp backup recommendation">recovery capabilities</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that businesses can store their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index">backups on-premises</a> for quick recovery in case of a system failure or disaster, while also keeping a copy of their<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/should we backup cloud apps"> backups offsite</a> to protect against site-level disasters.</p>
<p>The Barracuda backup storage unit also comes with built-in data deduplication and compression, which helps to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/wd gold enterprise vs dell poweredge">reduce storage requirements</a> and save businesses money on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/is billing clients to test backups normal">storage costs</a>. The appliance is also designed to be scalable, allowing businesses to add additional storage as their data backup needs grow.</p>
<p>The main issue with the 690 is that it only comes with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">software level RAID</a> which at this price point, I would have expected to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/list of high profile backup failures by msps">hardware RAID</a>.</p>
<p>If you need <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/list of high profile backup failures by msps">hardware level RAID</a> and my recommendation is that if you are paying this sort of money then you may as well obtain the next model up which is the Barracuda backup appliance 790 and that comes with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/list of high profile backup failures by msps">hardware RAID level 10</a> as well as the ability to add on 2 SFP+ ports.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There is a price jump though of around $5K</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barracuda Backup Appliance 690 RRP: $16,000</li>
<li>Barracuda Backup Appliance 790 RRP: $21,600</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="display-6">Network Attached Storage (NAS)</h2>
<p>Network disk storage such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps">Synology backups</a> are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/storage area networks index">storage device</a> that is connected to a network and provides storage space for multiple devices. NAS devices are designed to be easy to use and provide centralized storage for businesses. Here are some of the key features of NAS:</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Cost-Effective</h4>
<p>NAS devices such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/asustor drivestor 4 vs  asustor drivestor 4 pro">Asustor backup devices</a> are a cost-effective storage solution that offers businesses a centralized storage solution without the high costs associated with traditional storage solutions.</p>
<p>You can pick up a NAS drive for about $200 while the entry level Barracuda backup appliance 190 starts at around $1600 and by the time they are fully kitted out with storage it probably comes in at $600 versus $2100 respectively.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Easy to Use</h4>
<p>Network Storage such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/terramaster vs wd my cloud">Terramaster NAS</a> are designed to be easy to use and require minimal setup and maintenance. This makes them a great option for businesses that do not have dedicated IT resources.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Scalability</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/nas4free vs truenas">Open Source NAS devices</a> are also designed to be scalable, allowing businesses to add additional storage space as their needs grow.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Data Sharing</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/nas vs san">NAS servers</a> allow for easy data sharing across multiple devices and users. This makes it a great option for businesses that need to share data across multiple departments or teams.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Which One is Right for Your Business?</h2>
<p>When it comes to choosing between the Barracuda backup appliance 690 and something like a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas">custom built NAS drive</a> which you can build yourself with an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp open source apps-index">open source storage OS</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/truenas vs rockstor">TrueNAS</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/truenas vs  esos %E2%80%93 enterprise storage os">ESOS enterprise storage OS</a> , there is no clear winner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both options have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. To determine which option is right for your business, consider your specific needs, budget, and IT resources.</p>
<p>I will say that the lower end Barracuda backup appliance 190 is within reach of even the smallest business and when you factor in that a backup appliance is less resource intensive as far as IT support is concerned, it can actually be a cheaper option in the long run.</p>
<p>For businesses that require <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">rapid data recovery</a> and comprehensive backup options, the Barracuda backup appliance 690 may be the better choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if cost-effectiveness and easy data sharing are top priorities, then NAS may be the better choice.</p>
<p>After carefully comparing and contrasting Barracuda backup appliances and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">centralized network storage</a>, our conclusion is that the backup device by Barracuda is the better option for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">managed service providers (MSPs)</a> who need reliable and efficient data backup solutions.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of a backup appliance is its all-in-one design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This appliance includes all the necessary components, including hardware and software, for efficient data backup and recovery. It is also easy to set up and manage, which makes it an ideal solution for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">MSPs</a> with limited resources.</p>
<p>In contrast, custom server and NAS solutions can require <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">additional hardware</a> and software components to provide reliable data backup and recovery services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can make it more challenging for MSPs to manage and maintain these systems effectively.</p>
<p>It also means you have to lean heavily on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">technical expertise</a> of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employee</a> doing the work and hope they have not missed a critical component.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another advantage of the Barracuda Backup Appliance 690 is its comprehensive data protection features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This appliance offers automated backup and recovery, replication, and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas/backups as a service">cloud integration</a>. These features ensure that MSPs can provide their clients with reliable and secure data backup solutions that can withstand any disaster.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a network storage server offers limited data protection features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These systems rely on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas">manual backups</a> and file transfers, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Additionally, NAS systems may not provide adequate protection against disasters like fires, floods, and earthquakes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Barracuda data protection appliance offers flexible deployment options, including <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">on-premises</a>, hybrid, and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud-based solutions</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This flexibility allows MSPs to customize their backup solutions to meet their clients' specific needs and budgets.</p>
<p>In contrast, a NAS typically only offers on-premises deployment options. This can limit MSPs' ability to provide their clients with flexible and cost-effective backup solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, the Barracuda Backup Appliance 690 has a proven track record of reliability and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This appliance provides fast backup and recovery times, minimal downtime, and seamless integration with other IT systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This reliability and efficiency can help MSPs to build strong relationships with their clients and grow their businesses.</p>
<p>While both the Barracuda backup solution and Network Attached Storage (NAS) have their advantages and disadvantages, the Barracuda Backup Appliance 690 is the better option for MSPs who need reliable, efficient, and comprehensive data backup solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Businesses should ensure they work with reliable vendors with a proven record of providing reliable solutions and support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping track of your clients' backup hardware devices whether it be an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/truenas vs openmediavault">open source based</a> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/truenas vs rockstor">TrueNAS device</a> or something like a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/oracle zero data loss recovery appliance vs acronis cyber appliance">Oracle Zero data loss recovery appliance</a>, a robust and reliable <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/#services">documentation framework</a> is important to have in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without that, your clients requests will take longer, their projects will be delayed and ultimately it can mean the difference between being profitable or not. Effective documentation for your clients when running complex tools is only important if you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">value your reputation</a>.</p>
