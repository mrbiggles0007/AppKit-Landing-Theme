Whether it is for small businesses or </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/enterprise drives purchased from amazon - warning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enterprise sized organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the right storage platform can help improve efficiency, productivity, and ultimately, profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will serve as a guide for I.T organizations who are considering either TrueNAS or Rockstor for their clients' storage needs. By the end of this article, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each platform and be better equipped to make an informed decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a secondary goal of the main discussion here, I will also discuss how documentation can help IT consulting services manage and maintain backup and data recovery solutions effectively as it specifically relates to this topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can help you respond faster to your </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clients requests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allow less experienced staff handle tasks they otherwise could not and ultimately improve your profit margins while getting ahead of your competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical recording strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be storage solutions discussed here or the steps involved on how you </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/legal hold and retention policies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manage client data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and when it should be deleted based on criteria such as their wishes along with regulations governing this activity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It enables IT consulting advisors to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their clients effectively.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We have years of experience in working with service providers to </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">document their procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; and as mentioned, there is no area more important to a service provider than how their clients' backup and disaster recovery systems are documented.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS versus Rockstor</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I.T implementation service organizations consider different storage solutions for their clients, it's important to compare the market leaders in </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open sourced storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operating systems - TrueNAS and Rockstor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are you have almost made a decision on either of these two backup </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating systems solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but are just not sure which one is the right fit for your situation. This article will help alleviate that concern.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage Operating System - Hardware Requirements</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS and Rockstor have different hardware requirements that I.T organizations should consider when selecting a storage solution for their clients.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS requires at least </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8GB of RAM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a 64-bit CPU, and a minimum of two </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NAS compatible hard drives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, for optimal performance it recommends at least 16GB of RAM, an Intel Xeon processor, and a minimum of six hard drives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Rockstor has lower hardware requirements, with a minimum of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer components index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8GB of RAM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, either a 32 or 64-bit CPU, and a minimum of one hard drive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor recommends at least 8GB of RAM, 1GB NIC, quad core 64-bit CPU&nbsp; and a minimum of 2 SSDs. While the recommended specs are quite low, it should be noted that if you do run resource heavy tasks then Rockstor is capable as long as the specifications are increased appropriately. Specifications can go a lot higher than the recommended specs.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supported Storage Protocols and File Systems</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS and Rockstor support slightly different protocols and file systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS supports NFS, SMB/CIFS, AFP, iSCSI, FC, and S3 protocols. Additionally, it also supports the ZFS file system, which provides advanced data management features such as snapshots, clones, and data compression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor supports NFS, SMB/CIFS, AFP, and FTP protocols.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can also be configured to run with iSCSI with a little more effort.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor also supports advanced data management features such as snapshots, clones, and data compression..</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage Scalability and High Availability</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scalability and high availability are important considerations for I.T service organizations when selecting a storage solution. TrueNAS and Rockstor have different approaches to scalability and high availability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both TrueNAS and Rockstor support </span><a href="https://cloudian.com/blog/scale-up-vs-scale-out-storage/#:~:text=Scale%2Dup is the most,limits of the storage controllers."><span style="font-weight: 400;">scale-up </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">architecture, however only TrueNAS supports scale-out</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> architecture.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a scale-up architecture, </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-hardware-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional hard drives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be added to a single system to increase storage capacity. In a scale-out architecture, additional systems can be added to the network to increase storage capacity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, TrueNAS supports high availability through </span><a href="https://www.truenas.com/blog/truenas-high-availability-ha-explained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">active-passive failover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where a secondary system takes over if the primary system fails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**Rockstor </span><strong>does not natively support </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">active-passive failover and is designed for stand alone storage systems.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage Data Protection and Management</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data protection and management are sought after aspects in any storage solution, and both TrueNAS and Rockstor offer different features in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS offers advanced data protection features such as </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual drive snapshots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, clones, and data compression.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapshots allow users to take point-in-time copies of their data for </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup and disaster recovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purposes. Clones allow users to create multiple copies of a dataset without duplicating data. Data compression reduces the size of data on the disk, resulting in improved storage efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor offers </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/choosing an msp backup solution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">simple data protection features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as RAID levels, hot spares, and replication. RAID levels provide redundancy in case of hard drive failure, while hot spares allow for immediate replacement of a failed drive. Replication allows data to be copied to a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remote site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for backup and recovery purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor Advantages</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor has several benefits that make it an appealing choice for some users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>These include:</strong></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linux Based Open Source Software</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor is built on the mature and well known Linux-based operating system, which provides flexibility and customization options for users familiar with Linux environments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows advanced users to leverage their Linux knowledge and expertise to fine-tune and customize the system according to their specific requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Based Software</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor is an </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp open source apps-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open-sourced solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means that the source code is available and can be modified and distributed by anyone. This can be an advantage for organizations that want to customize the software to meet their specific needs, or for individuals who want to learn more about how the software works.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTRFS File System</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor utilizes the Btrfs (B-tree file system) as its default file system. Btrfs offers several advanced features, including built-in snapshot capabilities, copy-on-write functionality, data checksums, and RAID support.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that this is a feature of the underlying operating system rather than Rockstor itself and as mentioned above, Rockstor does not have native capability for snapshot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensible Architecture</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor has a modular and extensible architecture that allows users to install additional software packages and plugins to enhance the functionality of their storage system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active Development and Community Support</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have ever been in the unfortunate position of having a great little application that does 80% of&nbsp; what you want it to and yet there is near zero ongoing development then you understand how important having an active community that consistently listens and adds worthwhile features is.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor Disadvantages</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are also some drawbacks to using Rockstor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>These include:</strong></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of Advanced Enterprise Features</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor lacks some important features many cannot do without such as active-passive failover, lack of 3rd party integration and lack of advanced data management processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is at least they have a paid edition which allows you to access many of the advanced features otherwise disabled on the free version.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited Number Of Hard Disks</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an unusual limitation however on the free version there is an upper limit to the number of SSD drives you can add to your attached storage before you need to invest in the paid version.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This limitation is quite low at only 2 hard disks meaning you can only use either no RAID, RAID 0 or RAID 1 limiting the quality of redundancy you are able to use.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small User Base</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor has a community that is very passionate however they are a small group when compared to the likes of TrueNAS and this can cause issues with getting questions answered.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited Hardware Compatibility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor supports a wide range of hardware, although it does not have the same level of hardware compatibility as TrueNAS.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS has been widely adopted and extensively tested on all of the most common hardware configurations, making it more likely to have official support and optimized performance on a broader range of drivers for hardware components..</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Verdict</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS is developed and supported by </span><a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iXsystems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a long established company with history in the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data storage industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. iXsystems has committed to continuing its use of open-source software and is dedicated to the ongoing development and improvement of TrueNAS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their focus on continuous innovation and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave"><span style="font-weight: 400;">client satisfaction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contributes to the reliability and quality of the TrueNAS platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Rockstor also offers storage solutions, TrueNAS provides a far more comprehensive and mature feature set, better community support, scalability, and overall reliability for commercial environments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS is generally preferred for commercial environments and with good reason, there are no&nbsp; circumstances I can think of where Rockstor may be a more suitable choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The limitation of 2 hard drives when using the free version is just too big of a handicap to overcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the existing system is Rockstor, it would likely be a better strategy to remove it and put TrueNAS in its place especially if you believe there will be any sort of growth over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS is head and shoulders above Rockstor. We found it easier to navigate around and use. Overall it is just a much more sophisticated and proven product than Rockstor.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueNAS definitely wins in pretty much all areas in this head to head comparison although both have the ability to effectively run your network storage devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend TrueNAS for serious commercial undertakings and recommend only using Rockstor on very small clients where growth is not expected. We hope this article has provided you with a solid foundation and understanding of this topic.</span></p>
