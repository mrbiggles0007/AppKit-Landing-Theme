<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding a Server Based Backup Solution</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Servers are powerful computers that are designed to provide resources and services to other computers and devices on a network. They are typically used in businesses, schools, and other organizations that require a centralized system for managing and sharing data, applications, and other resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Here are some key aspects of Servers that you should be aware of:</strong></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definition of a Server</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">A </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/physical servers index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a computer device that provides a specific service to other devices or programs on a network. A Server can be a physical computer or a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual machine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is running on a host computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">It could be argued that all computing including </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud based computing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/cloud apps-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SaaS server</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based however we are not getting into that argument here and to keep things simple we are only discussing devices that serve other devices on the same </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local area network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls"><span style="font-weight: 400;">subnet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when we use the label of &ldquo;server&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">While it could also be argued that a network storage device itself is also a server, our definition of a server here is the traditional machines offered by the likes of </span><a href="https://www.dell.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have either </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual host operating systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> installed, </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows Server operating system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or one of the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open source operating systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">See how tough it gets when the word &ldquo;server&rdquo; is used. If however you are in the service provider industry, you know what meets the definition of server in our world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Some common types of servers include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>File Servers:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used for storing and sharing files on a network.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Application Servers:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used for running and managing applications on a network.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Web Servers:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used for hosting websites and web applications.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Database Servers:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used for storing and managing data on a network.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Backup Servers:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Used as a repository with a large storage capacity.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functions of a Backup Server</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">The primary function of a Server is to provide resources and services to other devices on a network.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>This includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storing backed up data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running and managing backup applications.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing centralized access control and security.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of Servers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">As mentioned earlier, there are different types of servers that serve different functions and not all servers are backup servers. Here's a brief overview of some of the most common types of Servers:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">File Servers</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">File Servers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are used for storing and sharing files on a network. They allow multiple users to access and modify files simultaneously, and they can be configured to provide different levels of access control and security. File Servers are typically used in businesses and organizations that require centralized storage for documents, images, videos, and other types of files.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application Servers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Application Servers are used for running and managing applications on a network. They allow multiple users to access the same application simultaneously, and they can be configured to provide different levels of access control and security. Application Servers are typically used in businesses and organizations that require centralized management of software applications.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Servers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Web Servers are used for hosting websites and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">web applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They allow users to access web content from anywhere in the world, and they can be configured to provide different levels of access control and security. Web Servers are typically used in businesses and organizations that require a public-facing web presence.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Database Servers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Database Servers are used for storing and managing data on a network. They allow multiple users to access and modify the same data simultaneously, and they can be configured to provide different levels of access control and security. Database Servers are typically used in businesses and organizations that require centralized storage and management of large amounts of data.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages of using a Server for Backups</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">There are several advantages of using a Server in a business or organizational setting for backup purposes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>These include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scalability.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup clients overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multipurpose Use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralized management of data and resources.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved security and access control.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased efficiency and productivity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced hardware costs and maintenance (Not always)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">In summary, Servers are powerful computers that are designed to provide resources and services to other devices on a network and are perfectly suited for use as dedicated backup servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">They come in different types and serve different functions, and they offer several advantages over traditional computing models. In the next section, we'll take a closer look at network storage device and compare them with Servers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Cases for Network Storage Devices</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Network storage devices, on the other hand, are ideal for businesses that require a cost-effective solution for storing and sharing data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">While they can be a more cost effective solution than using a general server, once you start looking at packing on performance options including </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high speed SSDs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, top end processors and large amounts of RAM, network storage devices can quite easily surpass the cost of a general purpose servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Network storage devices are great when you may not have </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high level expertise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on tap and just need a simple solution that has reasonable expandability options for the future while also coming in at a reasonable cost. They are also good in circumstances when data storage and data backup is your only focus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">When integrating with an existing </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active Directory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there can be some catches that you need to be aware of. I have found it is best to not make it part of the AD if you are using it specifically for backups. This is because if your AD fails or cannot access a DC then you can have a great deal of trouble accessing your backups as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">In my opinion, I have always found that using servers or </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/virtual machine index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for client operating data is the best mainly due to it having far better performance at the same price point. Client data should also come under the AD umbrella of security. Leave network storage devices for what they are good at, as a reliable backup device that sits in the corner doing its thing year in year out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">In general, network storage devices do tend to be slower when compared to the equivalent specification of a general purpose server.</span></p>
<p><strong>Here are some use cases for network storage device:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Third Party Apps: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most backup operating systems that come with a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/patch panels"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commercial network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> storage devices will offer an easy interface with third party and open source applications.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shallow Learning Curve:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Network storage drives tend to be a lot less complex than setting up a server.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Media streaming:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> network storage devices can be used to store and stream media files such as music, videos, and photos.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Data backup:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> network storage devices can be used to backup important data, providing an added layer of protection against data loss.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Surveillance:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> network storage devices can also be used for video surveillance, allowing businesses to monitor their premises and ensure the safety of their employees and assets.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">NAS Versus Server Outcome</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">For IT contract service organizations, documentation is key to the success of their business. By documenting their clients' IT infrastructure, service providers can provide better support, as well as ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Service providers need to document the type of system, its configuration, and its use case. This documentation will be important in identifying potential issues, troubleshooting problems, and ensuring that the system is running at optimal efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">After comparing the use cases for a general Server versus a network storage devices where backup is its primary case use, it is reasonably straightforward which path should be taken. Hands down, when it comes to a dedicated backup only device, a network storage device is my recommendation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">When it comes to flexibility and scalability, of course the server will win however sometimes these areas do not need to be off the charts for the device to be effective. You want to buy something that will do the job you need it to do at the time you purchase it, especially when it comes to technology these days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">You want a network storage device to last 3 maybe 5 years at most, the way technology is advancing, it could well be a waste of money to pay extra for flexibility and scalability when the chances are, the spec you purchased it at will be the spec it is decommissioned at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">While it is true that when it comes to data storage capacity, servers are more flexible and can accommodate a wide range of hard drives, while network storage device devices are limited in their expansion capabilities, chances are that if you purchase with a little room for growth, that will allow you to add more drives if space becomes an issue sooner than 3 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">When it comes to </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/mssps - index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both servers and network storage devices offer encryption options and other security measures to protect data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">However, while servers offer more options for customization and control, making them the better choice on paper, as mentioned above, if the network storage device is used for backup purposes, it is actually good practice to ensure it does not form part of your Active Directory.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">The onboard security precautions are more than adequate in most commercial devices these days and they all come with either lifetime updates or subscription based updates either of which will ensure you have the opportunity to keep it updated for its 3 to 5 year life span.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Both servers and network storage devices have their advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the specific needs of the business. My results show that both options can provide reliable and efficient data storage solutions when implemented correctly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">As technology continues to evolve, it is important to stay up-to-date with the latest hardware and software solutions to ensure that the business is operating at its full potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Both options are good solutions for anyone looking to purchase a good quality backup storage device that they can build on. We hope this article has provided you with a solid foundation and understanding of this topic.</span></p>
