<p>Barracuda versus StoreOnce, specifically the Barracuda backup 790 versus the HPE StoreOnce 3620 backup appliances will be the topic of today&rsquo;s article.</p>
<p>I will touch on several other models including the&nbsp; Barracuda backup 190 and HPE storeOnce 3660. If you are interested in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/barracuda backup appliance vs network attached storage">Barracuda 690 backup appliance</a> then that model is discussed in more detail in the following <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/barracuda backup appliance vs network attached storage">article</a>.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Barracuda 790 Versus HPE StoreOnce 3620</h2>
<p>If looking at these 2 backup appliances individually, it is not exactly intuitive to compare the two. However keep in mind that the Barracuda 790 backup appliance comes with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">storage included</a> in the price.</p>
<p>This brings both backup appliances much closer together in performance. The HPE StoreOnce price is quite a bit less and it could be argued that the Barracuda backup server 790 specs are not conducive to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">upgrades</a> however, putting them together and the decision on which to choose becomes much more difficult as the table below demonstrates.</p>
<p>The Barracuda Backup 790 specs are certainly less likely to be easily upgraded and the HPE StoreOnce price is lower so if you are an organization that is likely to grow within 3 to 5 years then the HPE StoreOnce backup appliance is going to be the obvious choice.</p>
<p>When you consider that the Barracuda 790 appliance comes with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/cables &amp; adapters">2x 10GbE network slots</a> as standard along with all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">storage hardware</a> along with the fact the interface is much more intuitive coupled with a lower <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">total cost of ownership</a> over 5 years then if your organization is likely to remain the same size then I would probably look at the Barracuda 790 appliance due to its turnkey nature.</p>

<p>Barracuda Cloud-to-Cloud Backup enables an organization to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">protect information</a> located on a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">virtual appliance</a>, physical backup appliance or through an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">approved managed service provider</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, I am only concentrating on the physical backup appliance side of things including the MS O365 cloud to cloud backup option. The cloud to cloud backup solution by Barracuda is compatible with the entire range of Barracuda backup appliances.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Barracuda Cloud-to-Cloud Backup Locations</h4>
<p>There are 3 choices of location for cloud to cloud backup and that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barracuda Cloud</li>
<li>Local site to local site</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="display-4">Barracuda Cloud To Cloud Backup For Office 365</h4>
<p>Barracuda Cloud-to-Cloud Backup Pricing for O365 is as follows and is for up to ten thousand users. You have to love the discounts they hand out for bulk order /s. The minimum number of Barracuda O365 licenses is 25.</p>

<h4 class="display-4">Barracuda Energize Updates Option</h4>
<p>This is an included option when purchasing a Barracuda Cloud-to-Cloud backup solution. It should be noted that this is only 12 months of updates and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">free basic level technical support</a> during office hours.</p>
<p>After 12 months, the yearly subscription for Barracuda energize updates is around $3,800 a year for the Barracuda 790 backup appliance. Remember this only <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">includes basic support</a> that purports to include 24/7 email. Of course these will only be answered during business hours.</p>
<p>It also comes with 9-5pm <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">telephone support</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Barracuda Instant Replacement With 24x7 Support</h4>
<p>The cost for Instant Replacement with 24x7 Support for the Barracuda 790 backup appliance is going to come in at around $4,500</p>
<p>It should be noted that Barracuda &ldquo;instant replacement&rdquo; is their way of saying <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">next business day support</a> and it is available for up to 5 years. It also includes participation in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware refresh program</a>, storage device replacement as well as data migration on the replacement device.</p>
<p>This is almost a necessity when you consider their standard warranty is only return to base.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Barracuda Professional Support</h4>
<p>This is independent of the Barracuda Instant replacement service and it does come with a bunch of &ldquo;features&rdquo; that are great but the main reason to look at the professional level services is for the direct access to the equivalent of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">level 3 consultant</a>.</p>
<p>This includes in the service the ability to request advice on planned upgrades, maintenance as well as the current setup directly from your assigned consultant.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Barracuda Backup Appliance 190 And 490</h2>
<p>Below are some of the specs of other Barracuda Backup Models that I have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">used in the past</a> that may be a little further down the trough as far as cost is concerned while also providing excellent performance in their relevant <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">price ranges</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Barracuda Backup Appliance 190</h4>
<p>For about $1,600, the Barracuda Backup Server 190 Specs mean it&nbsp; is entry level coming with 1 terabyte of usable storage on a single <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives">1 terabyte SSD</a>. It comes in a desktop small form factor size although there are adapters that can be purchased if you want to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rackmount computers">mount it in a rack</a>.</p>
<p>The total cost of ownership is far lower than the 790 and it is conceivable and affordable for any business over about <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">5 staff</a> and will work well for any company with less than about 700GB of information that needs backing up (excluding O365)</p>
<p>Barracuda offer storage for $50 for each 200 gigabytes per month. When you consider its maximum capacity is 1 terabyte that could mean you are hitting $250 per month at its maximum or $3,000 per year.</p>
<p>So if your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">total backup size</a> is below 200 gigabytes or $50 per month then you are slightly better off paying the $50 rather than the unlimited Barracuda cloud storage subscription as it comes in at less than $760.</p>
<p>Once it goes above 200 gigabytes in size then you will be far better off purchasing the Barracuda unlimited storage subscription.</p>
<p>Below are the costs associated with owning a Barracuda 190 Backup appliance.</p>

<h4 class="display-4">Barracuda Backup Appliance 490</h4>
<p>The Barracuda Backup 490 Price of around $8,500 puts it dead set between the Barracuda 190 and the 790 backup appliance.</p>
<p>The 490 backup appliance comes in a 1U form factor and 8 Terabytes of usable storage via 4x <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives">4 terabyte SSDs</a>. The disparity between the 16 terabytes of storage and 8 terabytes of usable storage is due to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">RAID 10 array</a>.</p>
<p>The Barracuda Backup Server 490 Specs make it the first in the lineup that includes hot swappable storage devices however it does not include <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/power hardware">hot swappable power supply units</a> meaning that if the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/power hardware">PSU dies</a>, there will be downtime required to replace it.</p>
<p>Barracuda offer storage for $50 for each 200 gigabytes per month. When you consider its maximum capacity is 8 terabytes that could mean you are hitting $2,000 per month at its maximum or $24,000 per year.</p>
<p>So if your backups are below 1.4 terabytes or $350 per month then you are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">better off paying</a> the $350 rather than the unlimited Barracuda cloud storage subscription as it comes in at less than $4,500 in a 12 month period.</p>
<p>Once it goes above 1.4 terabytes in size then you will be far <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">better off purchasing</a> the Barracuda unlimited storage subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a sliding scale type of a deal so it is something you need to keep an eye on for that point where it becomes<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp"> cost effective</a> to purchase the unlimited cloud storage subscription via Barracuda.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If your organization is unlikely to expand significantly within the next 3 years then the turnkey nature of the Barracuda lineup of backup appliances is likely the best option. They come with all hardware required including matched storage devices and the admin console is arguably more intuitive than the HPE StoreOnce counterpart.</p>
<p>If you envisage significant growth within the next 3 years then it is likely a better option to go for the HP Enterprise StoreOnce range of backup appliances due to the highly configurable nature as well as the ability to select the right type of storage devices required.</p>
<p>The HPE StoreOnce range of backup appliances also have the headroom to expand if required.</p>
