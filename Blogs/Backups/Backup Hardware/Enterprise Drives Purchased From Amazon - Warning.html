<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">For most </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North American businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, effective data management is important for success. The importance of utilizing </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liabilities of hosting client backups"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliable hardware solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cannot be understated. In particular, enterprise storage drives are essential components of a robust data storage infrastructure especially if you plan on backing up </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liability waiver when client declines msp backup recommendation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">client data as a service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">In recent years, purchasing enterprise disk drives from online platforms like </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has become increasingly common. While this option may seem convenient and cost-effective, there are </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential risks associated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with buying Business-level hard drives from third-party sellers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are Enterprise Drives?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Business-grade drives are a type of hard drive specifically designed for use in high-performance computing and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-hardware-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data storage applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These drives are optimized for reliability, durability, and performance, making them ideal for use in enterprise-level data centers, </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud computing environments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other high-traffic data storage applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Unlike </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/consumer routers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consumer-grade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hard drives, enterprise storage drives are designed to operate 24/7, with the ability to handle heavy workloads and frequent read/write operations. They are typically rated for a </span><strong>higher number of total drive writes per day</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DWPD), which is a measure of the drive's durability and ability to handle frequent data writes. Corporate hard drives also offer </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher storage capacities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and faster data transfer speeds than consumer-grade drives, making them essential for businesses that require fast and reliable access to their data.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of Commercial Storage Drives</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">While </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSD drives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are rapidly overtaking the market, we will be concentrating on the most widely used drives currently in use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">There are two main types of business-level hard drives: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Attached_SCSI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAS (Serial Attached SCSI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/Serial-ATA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SATA (Serial ATA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SAS drives are designed for high-performance computing applications and are typically used in large data centers and cloud computing environments. These drives offer faster data transfer speeds and are more reliable than SATA drives, but they are also more expensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">SATA drives, on the other hand, are designed for more general-purpose computing applications and are often used in small and medium-sized businesses. These drives are less expensive than SAS drives, but they offer lower data transfer speeds and are less reliable. However, for many businesses, SATA drives are a more cost-effective solution that still provides adequate performance and reliability for their needs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risks of Purchasing Commercial Storage Drives</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Unlike consumer hard disks, commercial storage rapidly increases in price especially when you consider that even </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small Network Attached Storage devices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will take from 5 to 20 hard disks and if you are using them in a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/are storage area networks dead"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then it could be even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">This is one time where buying an </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/barracuda backup appliance vs network attached storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">off the shelf backup appliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is worth the extra cost as this is not a risk you then have to deal with. If you are keen on skipping the risk that comes with sourcing your own commercial grade SAS disks then take a look at some of the guides we put together on the top backup appliances currently available:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">While purchasing business-class drives from Amazon may seem like a convenient and cost-effective solution, there are potential risks associated with buying these drives from third-party sellers on the platform. One of the main risks is the potential for counterfeit or refurbished drives being sold as new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Counterfeit drives are supposed professional-grade drives that have been manufactured to look like genuine business-class drives but are actually cheap knockoffs that are prone to failure. These drives often have lower storage capacities and slower data transfer speeds than genuine enterprise storage drives, and they are much less reliable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Refurbished drives, on the other hand, are used drives that have been reconditioned and sold as if they were new. While some refurbished drives may be reliable and function properly, others may have hidden defects or performance issues that are not immediately apparent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Another risk of purchasing corporate-grade drives from Amazon is the potential for receiving drives that are not covered by the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacturer's warranty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many third-party sellers on Amazon sell drives that are no longer covered by the original manufacturer's warranty or offer their own limited warranties that may not provide adequate protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Finally, purchasing commercial drives from Amazon can also pose a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security risk for businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If a third-party seller is not reputable or trustworthy, they may be able to access sensitive data stored on the drives, which can lead to data breaches and other </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips for Purchasing Corporate Storage Solutions</span></h2>
<p><strong>To ensure that you are getting the most out of your purchase of commercial drives from Amazon, here are some best practices to follow:</strong></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Check the Seller's Ratings and Reviews</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Before making any purchase, take some time to review the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/it hardware vendors index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seller's ratings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client expectations on enterprise backup solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feedback from previous customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Look for sellers with a high rating and positive reviews. This can help ensure that you are purchasing from a reputable seller who has a history of delivering quality products.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Look for Enterprise-Class Drives</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Make sure that you are purchasing enterprise-class drives that are specifically designed for high-performance and reliability. These drives typically have higher data transfer rates, longer lifespans, and are built with more durable materials than </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/consumer routers index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consumer-grade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drives.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Verify the Drive's Compatibility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Before making a purchase, make sure that the drive is compatible with your system. Check the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacturer's website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for compatibility information or consult with a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trusted IT professional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Verify the Drive's Warranty</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Check the warranty information provided by the seller to make sure that the drive is covered by a warranty. This can help protect your investment in case of any defects or issues with the drive.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Consider the Price</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">While it may be tempting to purchase the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheapest option available</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, keep in mind that quality corporate-grade drives come at a premium price. Be prepared to spend a little more for a reliable, high-performance drive that will meet your needs in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">By following these best practices, you can make an informed decision when purchasing corporate-grade drives from Amazon and ensure that you are getting a quality product that will meet your needs.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Recovery for Enterprise Drives&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">As technology continues to advance, businesses are accumulating massive amounts of data. As a result, the demand for </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/legal ramifications of hosting your clients data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">larger storage capacity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and higher performance in storage systems has increased.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Corporate-grade drives have become a popular choice for businesses due to their durability, reliability, and high capacity. However purchasing professional-grade drives from Amazon can be risky due to the potential for counterfeit or refurbished drives being sold as new.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risks of Using Counterfeit or Refurbished Drives&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Using counterfeit or refurbished enterprise-class drives can lead to various risks and issues for businesses. Firstly, these drives may not have the same level of performance or reliability as genuine drives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">This can lead to</span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/legal ramifications of hosting your clients data part 2"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data loss or corruption</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, resulting in downtime and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential revenue loss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the business. Additionally, using counterfeit or refurbished drives can violate the warranty and support agreements with the drive manufacturer, leaving the business to deal with any issues on their own.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of Using Genuine Corporate Hard Drives&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Using genuine enterprise storage drives provides numerous benefits for businesses. Genuine drives offer higher performance, reliability, and durability, ensuring that businesses can store and access their data quickly and safely. Genuine drives also come with a warranty and support agreement, providing peace of mind for businesses in case any issues arise.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Practices for Purchasing Genuine enterprise-class drives. To avoid the risks of purchasing counterfeit or refurbished professional-grade</span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> storage devices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it's important to follow best practices when purchasing drives. These practices include:</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchasing drives from authorized resellers or directly from the manufacturer.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verifying the authenticity of the drive by checking the serial number and other identifying information.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking the packaging and labels for signs of tampering or suspicious markings.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing the drive thoroughly upon receipt to ensure it meets performance and reliability standards.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Purchasing enterprise drives from Amazon can be a cost-effective option for many businesses. However, it is important to exercise caution and take necessary precautions to ensure that the drives are genuine and reliable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Through our analysis and research, we have found that while purchasing new drives </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/backup vendor experiences."><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly from manufacturers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or authorized resellers may provide more assurance, buying refurbished or used drives from Amazon can still be a viable option if done properly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Using third-party tools to verify the authenticity and condition of the drives, as well as choosing sellers with high ratings and positive reviews, can significantly increase the chances of a successful purchase.</span></p>
