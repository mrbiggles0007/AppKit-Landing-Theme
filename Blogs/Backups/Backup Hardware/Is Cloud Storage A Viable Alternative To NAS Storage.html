<h2 class="display-6">Why Is Cloud Storage Better Than Physical Storage?</h2>
<p>That is a pretty loaded question and a slightly better way to ask this is, is cloud storage better than physical storage? The answer is it depends and both have their place.</p>
<p>The reality of course is that this question is based on the perspective of the person asking the question. From a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-client-index">backup client's</a> point of view, it is quite reasonable to see <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud backup storage</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">local physical storage</a> as completely different technologies.</p>
<p>From a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">managed service provider's</a> perspective or an organization that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation for data centers">runs a datacenter</a>, they are the same thing. It is just the physical nature of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud backup storage</a> is hidden from view depending on your perspective however they are all based on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/storage area networks">physical storage devices</a> at some point.</p>
<p>While the lines are starting to blur between network storage vs cloud storage, they both have advantages and disadvantages depending on the budget and task they are required to do.</p>
<p>An example would be a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">client</a> who backs up say 200GB of data in total meaning likely 20GB or less of incremental changing data per month. If they are in a metro area like New York City or LA then they will have access to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">low cost high speed links</a> that would handle 20GB like a hot knife through butter.</p>
<p>However if they are in a rural location with patchy <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">internet link quality</a> and no availability to dedicated links and may need to rely on expensive satellite internet providers then having a NAS at each site <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/cables &amp; adapters">connected via ethernet</a> or microwave could be a far better backup solution.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">NAS Private Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>NAS private cloud storage is a very loose term and like anything in technology, it seems to get hijacked by different organizations to mean different things.</p>
<p>Barracuda for instance advertise <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/hpe storeonce backup appliance vs barracuda backup appliance">cloud-to-cloud backup solutions</a> that can be purchased where the name suggests that it backs up from one cloud location to another cloud backup location and you would be right yet it also means backing up from a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/backup appliance vs network attached storage">backup appliance</a>, NAS or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">virtual machine</a> as well.</p>
<p>In this article and my view on the definition of NAS private cloud storage is that it is any NAS device that has a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">backup application</a> that automatically backs up to the cloud, backs up from the cloud or backs up both ways.</p>
<p>So as an example, most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/synology diskstation vs rackstation">Synology rackstations</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/synology diskstation vs rackstation">diskstations</a> come with something called <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/synology diskstation vs rackstation">active backup</a> which is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">free application</a> (when you purchase their hardware) that requires no licenses and will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/data retention for ex365 employees">backup Office 365 user accounts</a> to the local NAS device. So backing up from the cloud.</p>
<p>It can also <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">backup local server</a> data locally to the NAS itself as well as to something like the AWS cloud or Synology&rsquo;s own NAS storage cloud. This is an example of backing up to the cloud.</p>
<p>In the Barracuda example, I think above the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/hpe storeonce backup appliance vs barracuda backup appliance">Barracuda 490 backup appliance</a>, you can backup as a sender and receiver too. You need to purchase via Barracuda for online storage at about $50 per 200 gigabytes per month.</p>
<p>Once you have an Barracuda online storage account, you can then backup from both the local backup storage appliance as well as from Microsoft O365 accounts directly to another cloud storage location (hence cloud-to-cloud backup)</p>
<h2 class="display-6">NAS Alternative?</h2>
<p>So cloud storage vs NAS storage is not really the question that should be asked. Cloud backup storage is defined by the way in which you pay for the service.</p>
<p>NAS storage is great if you have the resources and knowledge to purchase the backup hardware and set up the dedicated links required as well as maintain the infrastructure on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Cloud backup storage is often a much cheaper and easier to manage solution in most cases and that is likely to be a continual trend going forward.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Remote Cloud Storage</h2>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">Internet storage</a> is a type of data storage where digital data is stored on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/should we backup cloud apps">remote servers</a> that can be accessed over the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data is generally backed up on the fly across the wire using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">efficient data compression</a> along with built in security using encryption.</p>
<p>The data is stored and managed by a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud data storage provider</a>, who is responsible for the security, availability, and maintenance of the storage infrastructure.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Cloud Backup Storage - Key Characteristics</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Cloud file storage allows users to access their data from anywhere with an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network switch index">internet connection</a>. This makes it easy to collaborate on files and share data with others.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Cloud data storage can be easily <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">scaled up</a> or down to meet the changing storage needs of businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-effectiveness:</strong> Cloud data hosting eliminates the need for businesses to invest in expensive <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">on-premise storage infrastructure</a>, which can be costly to maintain and upgrade.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Cloud data hosting providers employ various <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">security measures</a> to protect data from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security resources overview">cyber threats</a>, such as encryption, firewalls, and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/mssp overview">intrusion detection systems</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="display-4">Cloud Backup Storage - Drawbacks</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependency on internet connection:</strong> Since cloud content storage relies on the internet, users may experience slow access speeds or disruptions in service if their internet connection is slow or unreliable.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy concerns:</strong> Storing data on remote servers raises concerns about the privacy and security of sensitive data.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: While cloud data repository can be cost-effective in the long run, it may not be the best option for businesses with large amounts of data or high-performance requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="display-6">Network Attached Storage</h2>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas">LAN storage</a>, on the other hand, is a type of storage device that connects to a network and provides shared storage to multiple users and devices. Network storage devices can be accessed by users over the network, either through a wired or wireless connection.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Network Attached Storage - Key Characteristics</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/truenas-versus-nexenta-community-edition">NAS storage devices</a> can be easily configured and customized to meet the specific needs of businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability:</strong> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/backup appliance vs network attached storage">NAS devices</a> are designed to be reliable and can provide data redundancy and protection against data loss.</li>
<li><strong>Performance: </strong>NAS devices can provide high-speed access to data, making them ideal for businesses with high-performance requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="display-4">Network Attached Storage - Drawbacks</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complexity: </strong>Configuring and managing a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">network file storage device</a> can be complex and may require technical expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> While network file storage devices can be expanded to meet changing storage needs, they may not be as scalable as cloud file storage solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> network file storage devices can be expensive to purchase and maintain, especially for businesses with large amounts of data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When deciding whether to use cloud data hosting or network file storage devices, it all comes back to the dreaded &ldquo;<em>it depends</em>&rdquo; answer.</p>
<p>Cloud data hosting may be a better option for businesses that require flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, while network file storage devices may be more suitable for businesses with high-performance requirements and a need for data redundancy and protection.</p>
<p>Both options are good solutions for anyone looking to set up a competent backup solution for either clients or their own requirements. We hope this article has provided you with a solid foundation and understanding of this topic.</p>
