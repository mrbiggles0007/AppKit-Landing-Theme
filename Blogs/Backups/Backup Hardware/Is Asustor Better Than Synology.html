This feature is useful for multimedia enthusiasts who want to stream high-quality video and audio content directly from the NAS.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>App Central:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Asustor's App Central is a marketplace where you can download and install various apps and add-ons to extend the functionality of your NAS. App Central has a wide range of apps, including media servers, cloud storage services, and security apps.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ADM Operating System:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Asustor's ADM operating system is user-friendly and intuitive. It comes with a range of features, such as an online help center, a customizable desktop, and a mobile app for remote access.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synology Features and Capabilities</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Synology is known for its user-friendly </span><a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DSM operating system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a range of features that cater to both home and business users. Here are some of the notable features of Synology NAS:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>DiskStation Manager (DSM):</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DSM is Synology's operating system, which is renowned for its user-friendly interface and robust features. DSM comes with a range of apps and tools, such as a multimedia server, a file syncing app, and a cloud storage service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Surveillance Station: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synology's Surveillance Station is a powerful video surveillance software that can be used to monitor your home or business. It supports a wide range of IP cameras and comes with advanced features, such as motion detection, live streaming, and event recording.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>QuickConnect:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Synology's QuickConnect feature allows you to access your NAS from anywhere, without the need for complicated router configurations or port forwarding. QuickConnect uses a secure SSL connection, which ensures your data is encrypted and safe from prying eyes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Synology Hybrid RAID (SHR): </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">SHR is a flexible RAID system that is designed to simplify storage management. SHR can automatically optimize your storage capacity and protect your data from drive failures.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verdict</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Synology and Asustor are both excellent options for managed service providers looking for a reliable and high-performing NAS system. Both companies offer a range of models with various features and capabilities to meet the needs of different businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">However, in terms of overall performance and user-friendliness, </span><strong>Synology comes out as the clear winner</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their DiskStation Manager (DSM) operating system provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, making it simple for users to navigate and customize their NAS. Additionally, Synology offers a wider range of apps and integrations, allowing for greater flexibility and customization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">That being said, Asustor still provides a strong option for businesses with specific needs, such as those looking for a more affordable option or those in need of a larger storage capacity. Asustor also offers unique features such as the ability to run virtual machines on their NAS systems, which may be appealing to certain businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">Both Synology and Asustor offer options for backing up and securing important data. However, Synology's DSM operating system includes more robust backup and recovery options, as well as a built-in security center to help protect against potential security threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 350;">While both Synology and Asustor offer strong options for managed service providers, Synology stands out as the clear leader in terms of overall performance, user-friendliness, and security.&nbsp;</span></p>
