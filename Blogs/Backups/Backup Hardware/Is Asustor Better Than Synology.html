<p>Synology versus Asustor hardware <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">NAS device</a> will be the topic of today&rsquo;s article.</p>
<p>It is always tough to try and weed out the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">poor performing</a> NAS devices from the best quality NAS drives especially in the home or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas">enthusiast NAS</a> category. Fear not as I have whittled down the pack to two options and had two similar projects come up where both the Synology NAS and Asustor fit perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">purchased</a> one of each and did a little comparison. Save you reading further, the <strong>Synology came out on top</strong> but it is not clear cut and your use case may determine which platform is the best.</p>
<p>You only need to read further if you want the reasons why the Synology is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps">best entry level NAS device</a>.</p>
<p>Take a look at some of our other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">backup hardware articles</a> below that may interest you:</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Synology DS224+ versus Asustor AS5402t Gen 2</h2>
<p>The Synology DS224+ and the Asustor AS540t Gen2 were the two Network attached storage drives that after a couple hours research were the two I felt were the best fit for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">small business use</a> of my two <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">projects</a>.</p>
<p>I legitimately could not decide which one and because we were undertaking 2 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">similar projects</a>, I thought I would buy both and establish which one was best and incorporate the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">winning brand</a> into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">future projects</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that with these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps">entry level NAS devices</a> tend to be very similar across the brand so for example, the Synology will use the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">same OS</a> and methodology across the range of small business devices and I prefer doing that so that my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">support desk</a> become experts in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">single brand</a> rather than chopping and changing every time one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">NAS manufacturer</a> nudges slightly ahead with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting statistics on msp hardware purchasing">new feature</a>.</p>
<p>These NAS drives are firmly positioned in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">entry level small business sector</a> and I personally would not use them for anything over a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">light business use</a> case and having a staff number of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">under 10 staff</a>. Anything more and you really need to look at alternative <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/enterprise drives purchased from amazon - warning">enterprise level</a> NAS drives as a solution.</p>
<p>I am not going to go into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">massive detail</a> on every single feature of each as you can find those stats in a million places already. I am also not going to list a bunch of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware stats</a> as again you can find them elsewhere and not only that, they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/amazing msp facts and figures">change so fast</a> that it would date the article before I have finished it.</p>
<p>I just want to detail the areas I specifically found that were <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">either lacking</a> in one or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">noticeably better</a> in the other.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Synology DS224+ NAS Installation Project - 7 Staff</h4>
<p>One of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">refresh projects</a> involved a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">printing business</a> that had been using the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Hardware/TOP LEVEL PAGES/Workstations">front desk computer</a> as a storage repository by using the inbuilt <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/operating systems-index">Windows file security</a> along with its file sharing capability so that it was acting as their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">file server</a>.</p>
<p>To answer your question, yes they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">had been a client</a> for many years and I would discreetly attempt to convince them that this was a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">poor strategy</a> that causes many issues including <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">difficulty in backing</a> up their information as well as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">increase in downtime</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>Finally the owner decided to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/benefits to msps that ai is going to deliver">take our advice</a> after being <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">unable to access the information</a> as well as running a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise report</a> on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">true cost</a> of this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">budget setup</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Off topic</strong> - This is a very good example as to why <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">all MSPs</a> should be filling out their Category/Topic/Subtopic fields in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/microsoft-teams-integration">each ticket</a> that is worked on. We all have triggers that force us to judge others, sometimes harshly, well whenever I begin a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">new MSP documentation project</a> and I see nobody ever fills these areas in, I tend to judge harshly.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Asustor AS5402t Gen 2 NAS Installation Project - 6 Staff</h4>
<p>The second project which was carried out at roughly the same time was an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">electrical maintenance company</a> who had a slightly better setup in the form of a single <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network attached storage">Lacie network attached storage drive</a> as in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/cables &amp; adapters">single SATA</a> or perhaps even an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/cables &amp; adapters">IDE drive</a> in an enclosure which had an network interface.</p>
<p>This formed part of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">client onboarding project</a> and was one of our requirements for taking them on. Judging by the dust, I estimated the drive was at least 10 years old.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Network Attached Storage Operating Systems</h2>
<p>This is listed first because it is where I found the biggest difference and after using both NAS units for less than an hour, I already found myself suffering <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting statistics on msp hardware purchasing">buyer's remorse</a> with regard to the Asustor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a high level I just found myself <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">looking for features</a> that I thought were standard due to exposure with many other NAS operating systems only to find out they are missing and cannot be installed or if they can be installed, they require a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">higher level of expertise</a> than they should.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">installing at my client sites</a> are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware devices</a> that require a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">higher level of expertise</a> than they should as that costs me in terms of either <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">higher wages</a> due to needing more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">experienced onsite technicians</a> or I have to allow for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">less experienced staff</a> to take much longer to do a job that if I had purchased the least complex NAS device.</p>
<p>So if you go no further, understand that the Synology NAS operating system is more intuitive and has more features and allows better integration with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">third party apps</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a breakdown of the benefits and disadvantages of each NAS OS.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Synology DiskStation Manager - DSM</h4>
<p>I have used all sorts of network attached storage operating systems over the years including <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">shareware</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">freeware</a> NAS OS that is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/are storage area networks dead">hardware independent</a> all the way through to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">manufacturer specific</a> NAS operating systems and I have to say that the Synology DSM NAS OS software is a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>From initial OS setup and intuitiveness through to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">setup completion</a> and selecting from a range of different <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">3rd party cloud backup apps</a>, it was a breeze. There were no strange bugs or crashing from setup to operation and these units which have now both been operating for about 6 months now, the Synology has been the only one where we have not received any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">support calls</a> due to inaccessibility.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">admin console</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">user interface</a> is significantly better than the Asustor and from unboxing to the point it was a fully utilized NAS in a production environment was 45 minutes on the NAS side of things&nbsp;</p>
<p>This of course does not include the moving of old data and 2 hours of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/workstations index">workstation share mappings</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">reassuring client staff</a>.</p>
<p>Synology provides a built in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">sophisticated task scheduler</a> which helps when <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">running backup jobs</a> and implementing a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">regular maintenance strategy</a>. It felt light years ahead of the Asustor task scheduler and much easier to work with.</p>
<p>Synology DiskStation Manager also has very intuitive and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">detailed logs</a> and my overall opinion of the Synology NAS OS is that it is very polished and ideally suited to anyone that may be lacking in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">high level technical experience</a> that just wants the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rackmount computers">device setup</a> while also having access to a large number of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">3rd party integrations</a>.</p>
<p>The primary <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">reason to purchase</a> a Synology is its superior NAS operating system and let's face it, having superior performing NAS hardware is almost useless unless you have a competent NAS OS to drive it.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Asustor Data Master - ADM</h4>
<p>I found that Asustor ADM had a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">much steeper learning curve</a> and even though I have had <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">20+ years experience</a> working in and around NAS devices, I found some items difficult to find and ended up relying on Google to locate them. Not once did I need to google where to find something on the Synology device.</p>
<p>I found the Asustor ADM OS quite buggy and not nearly as refined as I was expecting. An example was <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">setting up a cabled printer</a> directly to the NAS that should have been very straight forward. This was a component of the project that we specified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This prerequisite had to be modified so that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">printer</a> continued to be shared via <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Hardware/TOP LEVEL PAGES/Workstations">desktop computer</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course this was after wasting 2 hours of time attempting to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Hardware/TOP LEVEL PAGES/Workstations">get the printer to work</a> via the NAS because we just thought it was something we were doing wrong only to find out that it is a known bug of which Asustor is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">blaming another party</a> and suggesting an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">update is required</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully we fell back on the truism of the client not caring as long as it all works but had it been a more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">sophisticated client</a>, we would have had to have replaced the NAS device <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">at our own cost</a> and likely <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">used it internally</a> for something we do not really need so we can tell ourselves we <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">did not just waste cash</a> and 8 hours labor on a boat anchor. Still, not ideal at all.</p>
<p>We had issues with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rugged computers">reset button</a> that required the removal of both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives">hdd drives</a> before it would work. Thankfully this problem was found prior to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/data retention for ex365 employees">copying across the data</a>. It probably would have been fine however anytime you start moving drives about, there is always a risk that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/best effort and msp liability">information will be lost</a>.</p>
<p>The other issue we found was that occasionally when I tried to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/operating systems-index">soft boot</a> the NAS, nothing would happen. This also occurred during <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/hardware apps overview">software updates</a> where it would appear to still work fine however the only way to force the NAS to reboot is to have one of the client staff members hold the on/off button down for a few seconds and then turn it on again.</p>
<p>This is not a good look especially when you as the MSP have talked them into this new far <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">superior system</a> compared to the 10 year old Lacie NAS drive that never had this problem.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that a NAS enclosure OS does not come with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">log files</a>, however we spent a good hour searching for them and failed to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">locate log files</a> for the unit. This to me is a serious oversight even for an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps">entry level NAS device</a> in today&rsquo;s market. There is a possibility they are hidden deep inside the OS however we do not have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">time to invest</a> in discovering them.</p>
<p>I have been pretty harsh on the Asustor ADM, probably because it cost an extra 8 hours of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">installation labor</a> which we could not in fairness <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">pass on to the client</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are one or two things I would consider an advantage though. It has a great little application called <a href="https://www.asustor.com/admv2?type=2&amp;subject=9&amp;sub=75">myarchive</a>. I have not found a 3rd party app available to Synology that works as well as the <a href="https://www.asustor.com/admv2?type=2&amp;subject=9&amp;sub=75">built in myarchive app</a> on the Asustor NAS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other benefit is that Asustor ADM allows it to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer peripherals index">booted from a USB</a> and allows for any other storage OS to be used in place of the built in ADM OS. We had so many issues with the ADM that we considered doing this however my gut feeling is that it would require <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">significant investment</a> from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">technical staff</a> to set it up and it would be an experience that would never be used again.</p>
<p>You can even install the Synology DSM OS onto the Asustor NAS this way however the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/operating systems-index">bootloader</a> that can do this has been created by a single person, their website has severe advert cancer and it is dubious as to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">legality of doing this</a> which is why I have not linked the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">application</a> here.</p>
<p>If you are desperate to replace Asustor ADM with Synology DSM then you can do a google search on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Xpenology&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enAU1045AU1045&amp;oq=Xpenology&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MgYIARBFGDwyBggCEEUYPDIGCAMQRRg80gEMMjIzNDQzNTBqMGo0qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Xpenology</a>. I would recommend against it because it appears to be a cat and mouse game between the guy who created it and Synology meaning every time a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-au/releaseNote/DSM">Synology update</a> comes out, there is no guarantee this guy will release an update to their update.</p>
<p>This means you could end up stuck on an update island with a DSM version several years old. On top of that is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">security concern</a> especially when installing these solutions into even the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">smallest of businesses</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, the Asustor ADM is adequate for only the most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">basic file sharing duties</a>. It is nowhere near as reliable as I had expected and the problem with sharing the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">directly attached printer</a> gave me <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">flashbacks to the late 90s</a>.</p>
<p>Unless you have very <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">senior techs</a> who are happy digging around in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">underlying Linux base</a> or want it for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">basic file sharing</a> only then the Synology DSM soundly trounces the Asustor ADM operating system.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">NAS Hardware Specs</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, I am not going to list a bunch of NAS specifications because they will be outdated by lunchtime tomorrow.</p>
<p>While I broke the NAS OS comparison into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">individual comparisons</a> of each NAS OS, from here on in, I am just going to list the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">benefits and the deficiencies</a> of each under the same heading.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">Hardware</a> is the only area where the Asustor definitely <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">comes out ahead</a> and it does so across its entire range. The<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting statistics on msp hardware purchasing"> build quality</a> seems significantly better on the Asustor enclosure than the Synology enclosure.</p>
<p>Examples I can think of apart from the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=A Whole Vibe">overall vibe</a> is that where Synology tends to use a lot of plastic in their enclosures, the Asustor appears to use machined aluminum and other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer components index">metal parts</a>. Items like the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer components index">screws and connectors</a> seem to all be a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">level up in quality</a> compared to the Synology.</p>
<p>Asustor also has a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">builtin HDMI port</a> which allows direct access to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">bios</a>. You are able to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">access the bios</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">change the boot order</a> and this then allows you to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">boot from USB</a>. You can boot from any NAS OS you want including a suspect version of Synology DSM (mentioned above) The OS is installed onto your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/wd gold enterprise vs dell poweredge">removable disks</a> and the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer peripherals index">USB stick</a> must remain in the slot so that it knows where to boot to.</p>
<p>It is a gut feeling but I would be slightly hesitant to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer peripherals index">boot from a USB stick</a> in this way especially over a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/synology diskstation vs rackstation">RAID array</a> including as low as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/synology diskstation vs rackstation">mirror array</a>. I say this because I once <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">installed a VSphere OS</a> across a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/synology diskstation vs wd my cloud">RAID5 array</a> and one of my staff attempted to undertake an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">update on VSphere</a> which caused the complete loss of 6 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/virtual machine index">virtual servers</a> that were <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/synology diskstation vs wd my cloud">running on the array</a>.</p>
<p>I became <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security vulnerability overview">aware of this vulnerability</a> about a year <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/quantum dxi-series backup appliances vs commvault hyperscale appliance">after the installation</a>. I had asked the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">staff member</a> to not <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liabilities of hosting client backups">install the update</a> if it was <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">installed across the array</a> (I could not remember exactly if I had done it this way) Being a Friday afternoon and a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">technician</a> who suffered a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=overconfident">severe case of overconfidence</a>, he ignored my request which led to one of the stressful weekends of my professional life. Thankfully we had <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup clients overview">good disaster recovery procedures</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/choosing an msp backup solution">staff induced disaster</a> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/choosing an msp backup solution">here</a></p>
<p>So I have an aversion to installing any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">operating system across an array</a> for this reason.</p>
<p>Another major advantage is that Asustor has <a href="https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/nvme/what-is-nvme/#:~:text=NVMe (nonvolatile memory express) is,all types of enterprise workloads.">full NVMe volume support</a> meaning that you can run them in all of your bays. The advantage here is that your NAS enclosure becomes an extremely fast and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/power hardware">very low power storage device</a> for the price of an entry level NAS enclosure (plus NVME costs) Synology does not have this capability at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Finally, Asustor has built in <a href="https://www.vsolcn.com/blog/25-gigabit-ethernet-25gbe-overview.html">2.5GbE</a> while most Synology entry level enclosures only come standard with 1GbE. In today&rsquo;s market that is a pretty significant difference because the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware</a> such as entry level Mini PC&rsquo;s and entry level network switches now come with <a href="https://www.vsolcn.com/blog/25-gigabit-ethernet-25gbe-overview.html">2.5GbE speed</a> as standard.</p>
<p>A few years ago having a <a href="https://www.vsolcn.com/blog/25-gigabit-ethernet-25gbe-overview.html">2.5GbE interface</a> on a NAS would have been as useful as pockets on a singlet but now that speed is available on even <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rackmount computers">entry level devices</a>, it legitimately means a doubling of speed that your NAS can communicate at.</p>
<p>Synology is really trailing the field when it comes to their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/cables &amp; adapters">interface speed</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, Asustor leads in all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">areas of hardware</a> from fit and finish of the enclosure as well as the specs of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">CPUs</a>, use of NVMe and interface speeds. Their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware</a> always seems to be significantly better at a cheaper price than Synology.</p>
<p>Think of a bodybuilder with athletic ability and an IQ of 12 and that is where the Asustor fits in.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Support And Self Help</h2>
<p>Synology wipes the floor as far as<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation"> self support available</a> on forums and Reddit.</p>
<p>This is because Synology is far larger and there is a much <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">larger user base</a>. If you are having a specific issue with Synology then someone has likely somewhere had the same problem and even better, they have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/what msp app to use for client documentation">probably written about it</a> in the form of a question and someone who has also had the problem and resolved it has the answer and it is all there online for you to find.</p>
<p>This turns 8 hour problems into 10 minute problems and I cannot overstate how much of an advantage this is when you are faced with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">seemingly complex issue</a> only to find the non logical solution within a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Asustor has about one tenth of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">online support</a> that Synology has if that. I would say 90% of the questions I have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">asked online</a> about Asustor devices have gone unanswered while all of my questions regarding Synology get answered and they get answered quickly. I put this down to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/">solid fanbase</a> that enjoys <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">showcasing their knowledge</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">Actual support</a> provided by Synology is mostly good and they have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">live chat function</a> to speed up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">support issues</a> unlike Asustor which only has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">email support</a>.</p>
<p>The community view is that Synology are actually pretty good as far as their support goes and when I say community, I am talking mainly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/">Reddit</a> however they only have a <a href="https://au.trustpilot.com/review/www.synology.com">2 star rating on trust pilot</a> with over 200 reviews so plenty of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=unhappy campers">unhappy campers</a> although I do find trust pilot tends to attract customers having a tough experience and so only people who have a complaint are likely to leave a review.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asustor/">Asustor reviews</a> in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asustor/">Reddit community</a> tend to be much worse and many questions go unanswered or are obviously incorrect.</p>
<p>Asustor has complaints both as far as complaints about support as well as complaints about the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">bugs and faults</a> they are dealing with. They have a higher score on <a href="https://au.trustpilot.com/review/asustor.com">trust pilot</a> however that is from a grand total of <a href="https://au.trustpilot.com/review/asustor.com">6 reviews</a> so is not a reliable sample size to gauge from.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">NAS Bang For Buck</h2>
<p>Asustor are always cheaper versus Synology and yet tend to have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/scientific &amp; laboratory computer hardware">better build quality</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">higher specced hardware</a> than the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">more expensive</a> Synology unit.</p>
<p>The Asustor is unfortunately let down by the NAS OS that it comes with and of course ultimately it does not matter how amazing the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">underlying hardware</a> is, if the software (brains) that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">run the hardware</a> are substandard and cannot extract that performance then often it is a better decision to purchase the NAS with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">evolved software</a> and slightly <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">lower specifications</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Synology invests considerable time and funds into making their NAS operating system (DSM) to be the most reliable, feature rich and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/application purchase and cloud-based subscription fees">intuitive application</a> it can be, meaning there is less room for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">higher end hardware</a> in their units for a given <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">price point</a>.</p>
<p>Asustor tends to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">invest more</a> in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">better hardware</a> and because of this lags a little when it comes to providing the best possible NAS OS.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">technical capability</a> to overcome the Asustor&rsquo;s application shortcomings or can circumvent it completely by booting into the NAS device with an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp open source apps-index">open source</a> NAS OS then it is very likely you could end up with a formidable NAS device that gets the best of both worlds, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">better hardware</a> on a very capable NAS OS.</p>
<p>If however you are the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">set and forget</a> type or run your MSP in a way that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">focuses on simplicity</a> so that your most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">junior help desk staff</a> can undertake the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">installation and maintenance</a> of a NAS enclosure then you cannot go past any of the Synology range of enclosures.</p>
<p>They are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/is asustor better than synology">intuitive and reliable</a> out of the box and the OS makes the most of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware</a> it runs on.</p>
