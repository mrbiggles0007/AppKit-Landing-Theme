<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Digital's </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/synology diskstation vs wd my cloud"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the form of My Cloud Home Duo and My Cloud EX2 Ultra are two options that are worth considering when looking for a small office or </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home Network storage solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yet they are relatively close in pricing and name, it is no wonder there is confusion over the differences and if the ultra version is worth the extra cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well we will attempt to answer these questions you have about these storage devices in this article.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These devices allow users to store, manage, and access their data easily, whether at home or in an office environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a secondary goal of the main discussion here, I will also discuss how documentation can help IT consulting services manage and maintain backup and information recovery solutions effectively as it specifically relates to this topic.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be storage solutions discussed here or the steps involved on how you </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/legal hold and retention policies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain client data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and when it should be deleted based on criteria such as their wishes along with regulations governing this activity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following sections, I will be exploring the quirks and features of&nbsp; My Cloud Home Duo and the My Cloud EX2 Ultra recovery appliances and comparing the two solutions to help IT network admin service companies make informed decisions for their clients.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Cloud Home Duo Vs EX2 Ultra</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The names are pretty much where the similarities end with these two devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The My Cloud Home Duo is a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/should we backup cloud apps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal cloud storage device</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed for individuals and families who want to securely store and access their digital content from anywhere.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It offers a simple and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">centralized storage solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for storing and organizing photos, videos, documents, and other files. The device comes with dual hard drives that provide </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mirrored backup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure data redundancy and protection against drive failure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is targeted towards home users and students who have multiple devices and want to back up and access their files</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The My Cloud EX2 Ultra on the other hand is a high performance unit by comparison and is targeted at small business or individuals who require a certain level of reliability over a long time frame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is for all intents and purposes quite a capable </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that comes with </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple drive bays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allow various RAID configurations. It also has some automatic backup capability via </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3rd party applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and integrates with a number of cloud providers.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Cloud EX2 Ultra Key Features</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The My Cloud EX2 Ultra </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managed service provider backups - client expectations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> device has several benefits that make it an appealing choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>These include:</strong></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple User Interface</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The My Cloud EX2 Ultra is designed to be user-friendly and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">easy to set up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> although not quite as simple and straightforward as the MyCloud Home. The general rule of thumb is as more people have to rely on the backup device doing its job, the more expensive and complex it becomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MyCloud Ultra is aimed at small business users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 Removable Drive Bays</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/nas vs san"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removable drive bays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> give the Ultra great potential at increasing the capacity at a point in the future without having to replace the enclosure meaning you can conceivably quadruple its storage size.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because its work loads are likely to be not as taxing as devices at the other end of the spectrum, there is a realistic potential that this could run for 10 years or so and because the storage can be increased, it makes that a practical reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote Access</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The My Cloud EX2 Ultra was created with the idea of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remote location access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your information in mind. You are able to easily access its information from anywhere and it can be done with the appropriate amount of security without requiring a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians"><span style="font-weight: 400;">network specialist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to set it up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worthy Mentions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The My Cloud EX2 Ultra also has great third party application support which improves the functionality substantially. You can run your home surveillance system with </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3rd party backup apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directly from this box with very little expertise to set it up. It is also quite competent in streaming media including movies or game consoles.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Cloud EX2 Ultra Disadvantages</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are also some drawbacks to using My Cloud EX2 Ultra.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>These include:</strong></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited Expansion Options</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hang on, I mentioned in the advantages that the MyCloud Ex2 Ultra has 2 removable drive bays, stating it has good expansion potential. How can I list it as a disadvantage as well?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this price point I think that expecting more than 2 removable drive bays is unrealistic and there are quite a lot of alternatives out there that are fixed drive solutions so with that in mind I see it has advantages in this area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However zooming out a little and when looking at NAS drive features as a whole, 2 drive bays are almost at the bottom rung of the ladder for expandability. If your business grows significantly at all then the best course of action here is to dust it off, gift wrap it and pass it off as new to one of the kids at Christmas. It is not capable of performing beyond a certain point.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendor Lock In</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are locked in to the </span><a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/products/network-attached-storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Digital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ecosystem and or the vendors that participate in that which can be a little frustrating. This is not a huge deal because the outlay for the backup hardware is relatively low.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that moving to any other similar </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/legal ramifications of hosting your clients data part 2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">archive storage solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not going to be as painful as if you had invested more money.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of Serious Enterprise Features</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The My Cloud EX2 Ultra is primarily designed for home or small office use and may not offer the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/enterprise drives purchased from amazon - warning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced enterprise-grade features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found in more expensive and higher-end NAS solutions. This includes features like </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtualization support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, advanced data protection options, or </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client refuses recommended backup solution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high availability configurations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price you will pay is always going to dictate the features you can expect and many of the higher end features are not feasible in a package at this price point.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Cloud Home Duo Key Features</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Cloud Home Duo has several benefits that make it an appealing choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>These include:</strong></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price Point</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An obvious benefit no doubt, the MyCloud Duo is about the cheapest point you could conceivably expect to purchase a device and legitimately call it network attached storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get hold of a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4TB unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for around $200 which is a great deal when you consider you are getting all the functionality of a basic NAS device with the redundancy of RAID 1.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple User Interface</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MyCloud Duo is designed to be user-friendly and easy to set up. It trades features and the ability to upgrade the unit in exchange for simplicity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dual Drive Redundancy</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The My Cloud Home Duo comes equipped with two hard drives configured in a RAID 1 (mirroring) setup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This provides </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/communicating backup retention policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data redundancy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ensuring that your data is safely stored on both drives. If one drive fails, the other drive retains a copy of your data. RAID 1 gives a nice feeling of comfort however its been our experience that generally if one drive dies, the second one also does or is not too far behind it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as data recovery though, RAID1 is a breeze to recover your information from as you can remove the working drive and plug it into a PC to extract without the need for data recovery specialists in the case of something like RAID5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that this is designed for simplicity and while there are some teardown videos online, it is not meant to be upgraded with new drives or extra memory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote Access</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The My Cloud Home Duo was created with the idea of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remote access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in mind. You are able to easily access its information from anywhere and it can be done with the appropriate amount of security without requiring a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">network specialist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to set it up.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Cloud Home Duo Disadvantages</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some drawbacks to using&nbsp; My Cloud Home Duo.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>These include:</strong></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited Ability To Upgrade</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the&nbsp; My Cloud Home Duo option has a much lower entry point compared to the My Cloud EX2 Ultra, there is a good reason for this. The Home Duo is designed to be simple and because of that any customization of hardware specification is non existent or difficult to achieve.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendor Lock In</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This goes hand in hand with the cost and the inability to upgrade hardware. If it cannot undertake the task you want it to out of the box then it likely never will.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also has a very select number of big name 3rd party applications such as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneDrive"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneDrive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/drive/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Drive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet Reliant</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is probably not an issue these days but it should be mentioned that the MyCloud Home Duo is about as useful as a one armed paper boy if it does not have access to the internet.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Verdict</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two devices may have similar names and both aimed at the entry level market segment, they both target two very distinct groups of people although there is a little overlap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Cloud EX2 Ultra is a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/is cloud storage a viable alternative to nas storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solid storage appliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that offers a good all in one package for a small business or individual who needs a reliable storage and backup system without needing to be a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving"><span style="font-weight: 400;">senior network engineer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get the thing up and running.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MyCloud Home Duo is better suited to a family wanting a hassle </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managed service provider backups - client expectations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free central file storage repository</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where it will not cause a crisis if it goes </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/issues trusting one backup vendor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe that you are likely to need to expand at any point in the next few years or need something you can rely on then we recommend going straight for the </span><a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/products/network-attached-storage/wd-my-cloud-expert-series-ex2-ultra#WDBVBZ0000NCH-NESN"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Cloud EX2 Ultra</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While discussing cost, I should point out that the EX2 Ultra appears to be cheaper than the HomeDuo, just remember that the EX2 Ultra does not come with storage devices included. You need to purchase your own disks separately or use the WD Configurator at the time of ordering to add them in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost difference is not that much and you will not paint yourself into a corner going with the Ultra as it allows for a little bit of growth over time. It is important to understand that it's not actually the price difference between the two devices that is the concern if you realize you need to upgrade to the EX2 Ultra down the track, it's the nightmare that comes with having to move what could be terabytes of data from one device to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how easy you think moving that data will be, it is very time consuming and makes the cost of the hardware pale into insignificance. Trust me, it's a job you do not want to be doing willy nilly just to save $100.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our strong recommendation is to go for the EX2 Ultra, it's better in every way except for a small difference in the cost.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The My Cloud ES Ultra&nbsp; wins in this head to head comparison, it's weird because I think the segment the HomeDuo fits in, well you may as well just buy a portable USB in most cases. I am sure everyone is different but when the price point is so close then the ability to expand even if it's just the storage size, I personally would not consider the HomeDuo even if it was just for me for home use.</span></p>
