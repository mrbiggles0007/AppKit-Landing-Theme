</ul>
<p>We will provide an overview of TrueNAS and Openmediavault, highlighting their quirks and features.</p>
<p>We will also provide opinions based on real world experience using these platforms and their implications for IT infrastructure solution providers.</p>
<p>Selecting the right <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">storage platform</a> that meets the unique needs of each business is one of the more important tasks of a service provider. Whether it is for small businesses or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/enterprise drives purchased from amazon - warning">enterprise-level organizations</a>, the right storage platform can help improve efficiency, productivity, and ultimately, profitability.</p>
<p>This article will serve as a guide for I.T organizations who are considering either TrueNAS or Openmediavault to control their storage devices. By the end of this article, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each platform and be better equipped to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>As a secondary goal of the main discussion here, I will also discuss how I.T documentation can help consulting services manage and maintain backup and data recovery solutions effectively as it specifically relates to this topic.</p>
<p>We can help you respond faster to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">clients requirements</a>, allow <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">less experienced staff</a> handle tasks they otherwise could not and ultimately improve your profit margins while getting ahead of your competition.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">Technician records</a> are an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be storage solutions discussed here or the steps involved on how you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/communicating backup retention policy">retain important client data</a> and when it should be deleted based on criteria such as their wishes along with regulations governing this activity.</p>
<p>It enables IT consulting advisors to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their clients effectively.</p>

<p>We have years of experience in working with service providers to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">document their procedures</a> and as mentioned, there is no area more important to a service provider than how their clients' backup and disaster recovery systems are documented.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">TrueNAS versus Openmediavault</h2>
<p>As IT infrastructure solution providers consider different storage solutions for their clients, it's important to compare the market leaders in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">open sourced storage</a> operating systems - TrueNAS and Openmediavault.</p>
<p>Chances are you have almost made a decision on either of these two backup <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Operating systems solutions</a> but are just not sure which one is the right fit for your situation. This article will help alleviate that concern.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Storage Operating System - Hardware Requirements</h2>
<p>TrueNAS and Openmediavault have different hardware requirements that I.T organizations should consider when selecting a storage solution for their clients.</p>
<p>TrueNAS requires at least <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">8GB of RAM</a>, a 64-bit CPU, and a minimum of two <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives">NAS compatible hard drives</a>. However, for optimal performance it recommends at least 16GB of RAM, an Intel Xeon processor, and a minimum of six hard drives.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Openmediavault has lower hardware requirements, with a minimum of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer components index">2GB of RAM</a>, either a 32 or 64-bit CPU, and a minimum of one hard drive.</p>
<p>Openmediavault recommends at least 4GB of RAM, 1GB NIC, 32 or 64-bit CPU and a minimum of 1 SSD. While the recommended specs are quite low, it should be noted that if you do run resource heavy tasks then Openmediavault is capable as long as the specifications are increased appropriately. Specifications can go a lot higher than the recommended specs.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Supported Storage Protocols and File Systems</h2>
<p>TrueNAS and Openmediavault support slightly different protocols and file systems.</p>
<p>TrueNAS supports NFS, SMB/CIFS, AFP, iSCSI, FC, and S3 protocols. Additionally, it also supports the ZFS file system, which provides advanced data management features such as snapshots, clones, and data compression.</p>
<p>Openmediavault supports NFS, SMB/CIFS, AFP, FTP and NFS-RDMA protocols.</p>
<p>Openmediavault does not support advanced data management features such as snapshots, clones, and data compression natively however there are third party backup plugins that can provide these features. It is a bit clunky though..</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Storage Scalability and High Availability</h2>
<p>Scalability and high availability are important considerations for IT infrastructure solution providers when selecting a storage solution. TrueNAS and Openmediavault have different approaches to scalability and high availability.</p>
<p>Both TrueNAS and Openmediavault support <a href="https://cloudian.com/blog/scale-up-vs-scale-out-storage/#:~:text=Scale%2Dup is the most,limits of the storage controllers.">scale-up and scale-out</a> architectures. In a scale-up architecture, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-hardware-index">additional SSDs</a> can be added to a single system to increase storage capacity. In a scale-out architecture, additional systems can be added to the network to increase storage capacity.</p>
<p>Additionally, TrueNAS supports high availability through <a href="https://www.truenas.com/blog/truenas-high-availability-ha-explained/">active-passive failover</a>, where a secondary system takes over if the primary system fails.</p>
<p>**Openmediavault <strong>does not natively support </strong>active-passive failover; however if you were really desperate, you could use a combination of third party applications combined with the built in ability of Linux to achieve these features. Not recommended though.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Storage Data Protection and Management</h2>
<p>Data protection and management are sought after aspects in any storage solution, and both TrueNAS and Openmediavault offer different features in this regard.</p>
<p>TrueNAS offers advanced data protection features such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">virtual drive snapshots</a>, clones, and data compression.</p>
<p>Snapshots allow users to take point-in-time copies of their data for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backup and disaster recovery</a> purposes. Clones allow users to create multiple copies of a dataset without duplicating data. Data compression reduces the size of data on the disk, resulting in improved storage efficiency.</p>
<p>Openmediavault offers <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/choosing an msp backup solution">simple storage protection features</a> such as RAID levels, hot spares, and replication. RAID levels provide redundancy in case of hard drive failure, while hot spares allow for immediate replacement of a failed drive. Replication allows data to be copied to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">remote site</a> for backup and recovery purposes.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Openmediavault Advantages</h2>
<p>Openmediavault has several benefits that make it an appealing choice for some users.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Storage Flexibility</h4>
<p>One of the main advantages of Openmediavault is its flexibility. It can be customized to suit the specific needs of a particular organization or individual user. It also supports a wide range of hardware platforms and architectures, making it a versatile solution.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Open Source Based Software</h4>
<p>Openmediavault is an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp open source apps-index">open-sourced solution</a>, which means that the source code is available and can be modified and distributed by anyone. This can be an advantage for organizations that want to customize the software to meet their specific needs, or for individuals who want to learn more about how the software works.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">User-Friendly Web Interface</h4>
<p>OMV has a really user-friendly web-based interface making it easy to manage and configure storage resources, network settings, user accounts, and other NAS functionalities with simplicity.</p>
<p>This makes OMV accessible to both novice technician and experienced users, enabling efficient management of storage infrastructure without extensive technical knowledge.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Extensive Plugin Ecosystem</h4>
<p>OMV has a great and wide ranging set of plugins (Not far from the likes of Synology) that it is compatible with which extend its functionality beyond basic NAS features.</p>
<p>The plugin system allows users to customize and enhance OMV based on their specific requirements.</p>
<p>From backup and replication tools to media servers and virtualization support, the plugin ecosystem provides a wide range of options to tailor OMV to your needs, making it a versatile and adaptable solution.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Active Community and Regular Updates</h4>
<p>Like many open source applications, OMV benefits from an active user community. The community actively contributes to the development, support, and improvement of OMV.</p>
<p>There are regular updates and bug fixes ensuring a stable and up-to-date NAS solution. My experience has been that it is one of the better communities out there.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Openmediavault Disadvantages</h2>
<p>However, there are also some drawbacks to using Openmediavault.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Lack of Advanced Enterprise Features</h4>
<p>While it is perfect for the home user or very small business, Openmediavault lacks some important features many cannot do without such as active-passive failover, deduplication, advanced snapshot management and lack of advanced data management processes.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Lack Of Official Tech Support</h4>
<p>Unlike TrueNAS, Openmediavault does not offer official commercial support. This means that users are reliant on community support forums and documentation for assistance with any issues that may arise. This is always going to be an issue when time is limited and of course the quality of support given is best effort only.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Scalability and Future Growth Potential</h4>
<p>As doctor Phil once said, let's not sugar coat things because you will eat that too.</p>
<p>Openmediavault is not in the same league as TrueNAS in nearly all areas. It is great for home and small business use but not for the high reliability needed in corporate environments. It does not compare to TrueNAS in that regard.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">The Verdict</h2>
<p>TrueNAS is developed and supported by <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/">iXsystems</a>, a reputable company with history in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">data storage industry</a>. iXsystems has committed to continuing its use of open-source software and is dedicated to the ongoing development and improvement of TrueNAS.</p>
<p>Their focus on continuous innovation and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">customer satisfaction</a> contributes to the reliability and quality of the TrueNAS platform.</p>
<p>While Openmediavault also offers storage solutions, they are not in the same ballpark as TrueNAS, not even the same game.</p>
<p>TrueNAS provides a far more comprehensive and mature feature set, better community support, scalability, and overall reliability for commercial environments.</p>
<p>TrueNAS is generally preferred for commercial environments and with good reason, there are no circumstances I can think of where Openmediavault may be a more suitable choice.</p>
<p>Even if the existing system is Openmediavault, it would likely be a better strategy to remove it and put TrueNAS in its place especially if you believe there will be any sort of growth over time.</p>
<p>TrueNAS is head and shoulders above Openmediavault. We found it easier to navigate around and use. Overall it is just a much more sophisticated and proven product than Openmediavault.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">The Conclusion</h2>
<p>TrueNAS definitely wins in pretty much all areas in this head to head comparison although both have the ability to effectively run your network storage devices.</p>
<p>We recommend TrueNAS for serious commercial undertakings and recommend only using Openmediavault on very small clients where growth is not expected. We hope this article has provided you with a solid foundation and understanding of this topic.</p>
