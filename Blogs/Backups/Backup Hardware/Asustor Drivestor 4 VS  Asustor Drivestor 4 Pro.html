<h4 class="display-4">Hard Drive Bays</h4>
<p>The Asustor Drivestor 4 has four drive bays, which can support up to 72TB of storage capacity (with 18TB drives). This means that you can store large amounts of data, including high-resolution photos and videos, without having to worry about running out of space. The drive bays also support 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch hard drives, giving you more flexibility when it comes to choosing the right drives for your needs.</h4>
<h4 class="display-4">Ethernet Ports</h4>
<p>The Asustor Drivestor 4 has two <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/cables &amp; adapters index">Gigabit Ethernet ports</a>, which allow for fast and reliable data transfer speeds. This is particularly useful for businesses that need to access and share data quickly and efficiently. The two Ethernet ports also support link aggregation, which means that you can combine the bandwidth of both ports to achieve even faster data transfer speeds.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">USB Ports</h4>
<p>The Asustor Drivestor 4 has two <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer peripherals index">USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports</a>, which allow you to connect external devices such as hard drives, printers, and cameras. This is particularly useful if you need to transfer data quickly or if you want to back up your data to an external device.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Key Features and Functionalities:</h2>
<p>The Asustor Drivestor 4 is packed with features and functionalities that make it an ideal <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">storage solution</a> for personal and small business use.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Easy Setup</h4>
<p>Setting up the Asustor Drivestor 4 is quick and easy thanks to the intuitive user interface. You can get your device up and running in just a few minutes, and the device is compatible with both Windows and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/msp managed mac backups">Mac computer systems</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Data Backup and Sync</h4>
<p>The Asustor Drivestor 4 comes with a built-in backup and sync app, which allows you to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/is cloud storage a viable alternative to nas storage">back up data to the cloud</a> or to another device. This is particularly useful if you want to ensure that your data is always safe and secure.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Media Server</h4>
<p>The Asustor Drivestor 4 can also function as a media server, which means that you can stream your media files (such as music, photos, and videos) to other devices such as TVs and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/mobile phones for business index">smartphones</a>. This is particularly useful if you want to access your media files from multiple devices.</p>
<p>When deciding between the Asustor Drivestor 4 and the Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro, it's important to consider your specific needs and use case. While both devices offer impressive specifications and features, there are some key differences that may sway your decision one way or the other.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Processor and Memory</h4>
<p>The Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro comes equipped with an Intel Celeron J4125 quad-core processor and 8GB of DDR4 memory, while the Asustor Drivestor 4 features a Realtek RTD1296 quad-core processor and 2GB of DDR4 memory. This means that the Pro model has more processing power and can handle more demanding tasks, such as running <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">multiple virtual machines</a> or transcoding 4K video.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Storage Capacity and Expandability</h4>
<p>Both devices support up to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas">four hard drives</a> or SSDs for a maximum storage capacity of 64TB. However, the Pro model offers more flexibility when it comes to expandability. It features two M.2 NVMe SSD slots for caching or system acceleration, as well as two 10GbE ports for high-speed network connectivity. The Asustor Drivestor 4, on the other hand, only has one 2.5GbE port and no SSD slots.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Ports and Connectivity</h4>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned 10GbE and 2.5GbE ports, the Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro also features two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, two HDMI 2.0a ports, and an S/PDIF audio output. This makes it a great option for multimedia enthusiasts who want to use their NAS as a media center or gaming machine. The Asustor Drivestor 4, by comparison, only has one USB 3.2 Gen 1 port and one HDMI 2.0a port.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Price and Value</h4>
<p>One of the biggest factors to consider when choosing between these two devices is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">price</a>. The Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro is significantly more expensive than the Asustor Drivestor 4, with a price tag that reflects its higher-end specs and features. However, if you require the extra processing power, storage expandability, and connectivity options, the Pro model may be well worth the investment.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Results</h2>
<p>After comparing the Asustor Drivestor 4 and Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro, it is clear that the Pro version is the better option for those who need a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/backup vendor experiences.">high-performance NAS system</a>. While both systems have similar hardware and software features, the Pro version has better specifications in terms of processor, memory, and storage capacity, making it more suitable for use in a professional environment.</p>
<p>One of the most notable differences between the two systems is the CPU. The Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro features a more powerful Intel Celeron J4125 quad-core 2.0 GHz processor, compared to the Asustor Drivestor 4's Intel Celeron J3355 dual-core 2.0 GHz processor. This difference in CPU power is especially important for applications that require more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client expectations on enterprise backup solutions">processing power</a>, such as media transcoding or virtual machines.</p>
<p>Another important difference is the storage capacity. The Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro can support up to four 18TB drives, while the Asustor Drivestor 4 can only support up to four 14TB drives. This means that the Pro version can offer more storage space, which is crucial for businesses or individuals who need to store <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">large amounts of data</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro has a higher memory capacity, which is important for multitasking and running multiple applications simultaneously. The Pro version comes with 4GB of DDR4 memory, compared to the 2GB of DDR3 memory found in the standard version.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while both the Asustor Drivestor 4 and Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro have similar features, the Pro version is the better choice for those who require a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">higher performance system</a> with more storage and memory capacity. As a provider of information governance to remote infrastructure management organizations, it is important to have the right tools to support the information governance process. The Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro can meet these requirements and deliver excellent results.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Businesses should ensure they work with reliable vendors with a proven record of providing reliable solutions and support. Keeping track of your clients' backup hardware devices whether it be Austor or even Synology backup devices, a robust and reliable <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">information governance framework</a> is important to have in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without that, your clients requests will take longer, their projects will be delayed and ultimately it can mean the difference between being profitable or not. Effective information governance for your clients when running complex tools is only important if you value your reputation.</p>
