<p><strong>Media Server: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Asustor Drivestor 4 can also function as a media server, which means that you can stream your media files (such as music, photos, and videos) to other devices such as TVs and smartphones. This is particularly useful if you want to access your media files from multiple devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When deciding between the Asustor Drivestor 4 and the Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro, it's important to consider your specific needs and use case. While both devices offer impressive specifications and features, there are some key differences that may sway your decision one way or the other.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processor and Memory</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro comes equipped with an Intel Celeron J4125 quad-core processor and 8GB of DDR4 memory, while the Asustor Drivestor 4 features a Realtek RTD1296 quad-core processor and 2GB of DDR4 memory. This means that the Pro model has more processing power and can handle more demanding tasks, such as running multiple virtual machines or transcoding 4K video.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage Capacity and Expandability</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both devices support up to four hard drives or SSDs for a maximum storage capacity of 64TB. However, the Pro model offers more flexibility when it comes to expandability. It features two M.2 NVMe SSD slots for caching or system acceleration, as well as two 10GbE ports for high-speed network connectivity. The Asustor Drivestor 4, on the other hand, only has one 2.5GbE port and no SSD slots.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ports and Connectivity</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the aforementioned 10GbE and 2.5GbE ports, the Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro also features two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, two HDMI 2.0a ports, and an S/PDIF audio output. This makes it a great option for multimedia enthusiasts who want to use their NAS as a media center or gaming machine. The Asustor Drivestor 4, by comparison, only has one USB 3.2 Gen 1 port and one HDMI 2.0a port.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price and Value</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, one of the biggest factors to consider when choosing between these two devices is the price. The Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro is significantly more expensive than the Asustor Drivestor 4, with a price tag that reflects its higher-end specs and features. However, if you require the extra processing power, storage expandability, and connectivity options, the Pro model may be well worth the investment.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed Services Provider Documentation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Managed Services Providers (MSPs), documentation is a crucial part of delivering high-quality services to their clients. By keeping detailed records of their clients' IT environments, MSPs can better understand their needs and proactively address potential issues before they become major problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to choosing a NAS device for MSP documentation, the Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro is a solid choice. Its powerful processor and ample memory ensure smooth performance when running resource-intensive documentation software, while its multiple network ports and storage expandability provide the flexibility MSPs need to grow and scale their operations.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Results Have Shown</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through our experience working with MSPs across North America, we have seen firsthand the benefits of using the Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro for documentation purposes. Its robust feature set, coupled with its reliability and ease of use, make it a standout option in a crowded market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After comparing the Asustor Drivestor 4 and Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro, it is clear that the Pro version is the better option for those who need a high-performance NAS system. While both systems have similar hardware and software features, the Pro version has better specifications in terms of processor, memory, and storage capacity, making it more suitable for use in a professional environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most notable differences between the two systems is the CPU. The Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro features a more powerful Intel Celeron J4125 quad-core 2.0 GHz processor, compared to the Asustor Drivestor 4's Intel Celeron J3355 dual-core 2.0 GHz processor. This difference in CPU power is especially important for applications that require more processing power, such as media transcoding or virtual machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important difference is the storage capacity. The Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro can support up to four 18TB drives, while the Asustor Drivestor 4 can only support up to four 14TB drives. This means that the Pro version can offer more storage space, which is crucial for businesses or individuals who need to store large amounts of data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro has a higher memory capacity, which is important for multitasking and running multiple applications simultaneously. The Pro version comes with 4GB of DDR4 memory, compared to the 2GB of DDR3 memory found in the standard version.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, while both the Asustor Drivestor 4 and Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro have similar features, the Pro version is the better choice for those who require a higher-performance system with more storage and memory capacity. As a provider of Managed Services Provider Documentation, it is essential to have the right tools to support the documentation process. The Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro can meet these requirements and deliver excellent results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My results show that the Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro is an excellent NAS system that provides exceptional performance and is ideal for businesses and individuals who require a powerful, reliable storage solution. As a documentation service provider for MSPs, it is critical to have reliable storage for backups and other critical data, and the Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro can deliver these capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for reading our overview article on the fundamentals and basics of Asustor Drivestor 4 versus Asustor Drivestor 4 Pro. We hope you found this article informative and helpful in understanding the key differences between these two products.</span></p>
