<h2 class="display-6">Building a DIY NAS with TrueNAS</h2>
<h4 class="display-4">Choosing the Hardware</h4>
<p>The first step in building DIY network storage with TrueNAS is selecting the hardware. When selecting the hardware for your NAS, you'll need to consider the following:</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Minimum Requirements</h4>
<p>While TrueNAS can run on a variety of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer peripherals index">hardware configurations</a>, there are some minimum requirements to keep in mind. At a minimum, your NAS should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 64-bit processor (Intel or AMD)</li>
<li>8GB of RAM</li>
<li>At least one Ethernet port</li>
<li>One or more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">hard drives for storage</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that<strong> these are minimum requirements</strong>, and you may need to adjust them based on your specific needs. For example, if you plan to store a large amount of data or use your NAS for media streaming, you may want to consider a higher-end processor and more RAM.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Recommended Components</h2>
<p>In addition to the minimum requirements, there are some recommended components that can help optimize your NAS's performance. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A dedicated Ethernet card</strong>: While a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/cables &amp; adapters index">single Ethernet port</a> may be sufficient for some users, a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/cables &amp; adapters">dedicated Ethernet card</a> can help improve performance and reliability, especially for high-traffic environments.</li>
<li><strong>A power-efficient CPU</strong>: Since your NAS will be running 24/7, a power-efficient CPU can help reduce electricity costs and prolong the life of your hardware.</li>
<li><strong>ECC RAM</strong>: Error-correcting code (ECC) RAM can help prevent data corruption and improve the reliability of your NAS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="display-6">Compatibility Considerations</h2>
<p>When selecting your hardware, it's important to consider compatibility with TrueNAS.

<p>With your bootable USB drive ready, you can now install TrueNAS. The installation process will vary depending on your hardware configuration, but generally involves booting from the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer peripherals index">USB drive</a> and following the prompts to install TrueNAS on your hard drive. It is very straightforward and there is no specialist expertise required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This does not mean that some experience and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">technical expertise</a> is not required once you get to the configuration part of the task.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Setting Up TrueNAS</h2>
<p>With TrueNAS installed on your NAS, the next step is to set it up. Here are the key configurations to consider:</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Configuring the Storage Pool</h4>
<p>The first step is to create the <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/coretutorials/storage/pools/poolcreate/#:~:text=To create a new pool,to open the Pool Manager.&amp;text=To begin%2C enter a name for the pool in Name.">storage pool</a>. TrueNAS uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS file system</a>, which offers advanced features like data compression, deduplication, and encryption.</p>
<p>To configure your storage pool, you'll need to create one or more virtual devices (vdevs) using your hard drives. You can choose between different RAID configurations, depending on your needs.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Creating Datasets</h4>
<p>Once you've configured your storage pool, you can create datasets. Datasets are essentially folders within your storage pool, and can be used to organize your files and set different permissions.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Setting Up Shares</h2>
<h4 class="display-4">TrueNAS CORE</h4>
<p>To set up shares in TrueNAS CORE, navigate to the "Sharing" tab and click "Add." From there, you can select the type of share you want to create, such as SMB, NFS, or AFP.

<h4 class="display-4">Planning Your Deployment</h4>
<p>Before you begin setting up your TrueNAS deployment, it is important to have a clear understanding of your organization's storage requirements. You should consider factors such as the amount of data you need to store, the number of users who will be accessing the data, and the level of redundancy that you require. This information will help you to determine the hardware requirements for your TrueNAS system and to plan the layout of your storage pools and datasets.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Configuring Storage Pools and Datasets</h4>
<p>One of the most important aspects of a TrueNAS deployment is the configuration of your storage pools and datasets. When creating storage pools, you should consider the level of redundancy that you require and choose a RAID level that provides the appropriate level of protection for your data. You should also carefully consider the layout of your storage pools to ensure that they are optimized for performance and scalability.</p>
<p>When creating datasets, it is important to choose the appropriate settings for your specific use case. For example, you may want to enable compression and deduplication to reduce storage space requirements, or you may want to disable these features to maximize performance.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Setting Up User Accounts and Permissions</h4>
<p>TrueNAS supports a variety of authentication and authorization mechanisms, including local user accounts, Active Directory integration, and LDAP integration. When setting up user accounts, you should carefully consider your organization's security requirements and choose the appropriate authentication mechanism. You should also carefully configure permissions for each user account to ensure that users have access only to the data that they need.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Configuring Replication and Backup</h4>
<p>One of the key benefits of TrueNAS is its ability to replicate data between systems and to create backups of your data. When configuring replication and backup, you should carefully consider your organization's recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) requirements. You should also consider the available bandwidth between your systems and choose a replication and backup strategy that can be completed within your available window.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Monitoring and Maintenance</h4>
<p>Once your TrueNAS deployment is up and running, it is important to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp monitoring apps-index-page">monitor the system</a> for performance and reliability issues. You should configure alerts for critical events such as disk failures, and you should regularly review system logs to identify any issues that require attention.</p>
