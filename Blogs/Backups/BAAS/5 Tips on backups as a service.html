<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backups as a Service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BaaS) is the discussion of today's article. Specifically I am going to give my 5 best tips for offering Backups as a Service in a generic sense.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">BaaS - Backups As A Service</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to maintain sonar systems many years ago and there was a piece of equipment called MAD or magnetic anomaly detector that we needed to be aware of that planes used to detect submarines. MAD also stands for mutually assured destruction as well as mean absolute deviation and several other meanings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backups as a Service have a similar problem. BaaS refers to backup as a service in this article, not backend as a service nor business as a service or any other definitions that now use the acronym BaaS.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">BaaS Definition Versus Cloud Backup</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a bit of confusion of whether Backups as a Service are different or the same thing as </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Do they mean the same thing? Well I have been in the business for 35 years and even I sometimes have a hard time figuring it out.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.msp360.com/resources/blog/benefits-of-backup-as-a-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSP360 believes in this article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Backup as a service is an alternative to </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on-premises backup services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> however I disagree with them on this. Backup as a service can absolutely include either a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/backup appliance vs network attached storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complete local backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/quantum dxi-series backup appliances vs commvault hyperscale appliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hybrid backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a full </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud backup only solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that is not what determines if something is a backup as a service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of a backup as a service offering that I used to sell back in the early 2000s involved a component that was </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardware As A Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the form of a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">file server</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network attached storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">network attached storage device</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a set of 5 </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USB hard disks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we organized to be taken off site each day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a component of this </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even back then where we used to undertake incremental backups of the clients data (data only) using </span><a href="https://www.vembu.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vembu Storegrid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This offering at the time was marketed as our Backup As A Service solution and make no bones about it, it was primarily a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/backup appliance vs network attached storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">BaaS The Clue Is In The Acronym</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name does not signify as to if it is a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/backup appliance vs network attached storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally based backup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solution or if it is a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud based backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The &ldquo;Service&rdquo; part of the name signifies part of the definition and &ldquo;Backup&rdquo; the other part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it is any service provided by a third party company which is usually a managed service provider with which they undertake a complete backup solution.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are Cloud Backups BaaS?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/msp cloud backups for workstations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can form the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> part of the cloud backup offering however they do not include the service component.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you signed up to say my favorite </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/cloud apps-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud backup vendor</span></a> <a href="https://afi.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">afi.ai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and you were the service provider using it to backup your own internal company information then it would not be a BaaS solution. Just the same as if your client signed up directly and took care of their </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/should we backup cloud apps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they would be using a cloud based backup solution and not a BaaS solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If part of your offering uses either </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cloud backups such as </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/should msps backup google workspace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Workspace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a combination of both and the rest was made up of services provided by you to the client that undertook tasks such as checking to ensure the backup was maintained in full working order then that meets the definition of what BaaS is.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is BaaS The Same As SaaS</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All BaaS comes under SaaS but not all SaaS comes under BaaS. The analogy here is that all backup software is software but not all software is backup software. I apologize, that is the best explanation I have.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip 1 - BaaS is An All In One Solution</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like anything in life, the people that know what they are doing and have done it many times before will be better at it, and can do it in far less time with a far better end result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backups as a Service is no different. If you are a service provider with even a modicum of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about managed service providers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">technical experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, chances are you have collected all of the little things that work over the years and have organized them into the best backup as a service solution that you can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client refuses recommended backup solution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential client</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looking for an MSP but are tempted to do it yourself then the mountain you have to climb if you want to have your backups managed internally with anything close to reliability, is so steep it would not be viable.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip 2 - Low Upfront Cost</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While your clients generally have to enter a contract for a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good backup as a service solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the initial monthly cost is far cheaper than if they had to purchase all of the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardware upfront</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or employ </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">technical staff internally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip 3 - Backup Expertise</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an organization that needs </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup expertise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then BaaS certainly helps in that area. Unlike say a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud backup app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its own, BaaS takes care of everything from errors that sometimes occur all the way through to testing the recovery procedure.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip 4 - Ability To Scale Backups</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging with a competent BaaS solution provider means that because they do this for a living, they are likely to foresee likely </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth potential</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on your </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vertical market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to speccing out any </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network attached storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local backup hardware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and using good quality cloud backup application vendors that are able to scale at a moments notice.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip 5 - Bring The Best Together As One</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending time planning the best </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">custom backup offering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you possibly can and drawing in all of the best components from various </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup vendors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to create an offering that is unique, cannot be easily duplicated and relies on the expertise of your technical support staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have more control and BaaS is far more reliable versus say sending a link to a client and expecting them to work it out themselves. I mean even if you have some sort of hands off strategy with a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single cloud provider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where you make commission on the sales, it is not optimum and could seriously tarnish your name if things go wrong.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering a BaaS to clients is no doubt a risky proposition if not well thought out but can also be very rewarding. By offering a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">well thought out backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can be automated to undertake </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/testing client backups &amp; restores"><span style="font-weight: 400;">test restores on a schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and follow the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/should msps backup google workspace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3-2-1 backup methodology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then you will have gone a long way to avoiding the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/legal ramifications of hosting your clients data part 2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">risk of litigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of clients if your solution fails to recover their information.</span></p>
