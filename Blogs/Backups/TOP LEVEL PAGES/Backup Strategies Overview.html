<p>Backup strategies are the discussion of all articles in this grouping of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backup related articles</a>.</p>
<p>The new generation really do not know how lucky they are with what seems like an unending selection of backup components that can be used to create a client backup strategy so beautiful that if not for the practicality, it could be displayed in an art gallery.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of running a scheduled task on a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/servers index">physical server</a> to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-hardware-index">tape device</a> which lets face it, was like living on the edge, now we have so many options now that I sometimes consider a moment's silence would be appropriate.</p>
<p>These are articles specifically relating to strategies used by backup service providers when compiling an optimum backup solution for their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-client-index">backup clients</a>. The articles below relate to sub topics such as financial backup strategies when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">estimating backup pricing</a>, how to select the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">right backup vendor</a> and of course how to go about selecting the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-applications-index">best backup application</a> as part of your overall backup strategy.</p>
<p>Any article that involves the high level strategy of anything from a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index">local backup</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud based backup</a> and especially <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas-index">backups as a service</a> will be listed below and will be added appropriately.</p>
<p>Strategies involving <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-hardware-index">hardware backup devices</a> will be also listed as long as the devices form only a small part of a high level discussion on backup strategy otherwise <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-hardware-index">backup hardware</a> articles are listed separately in the hardware overview below.</p>
<p>You know sometimes in places I do not talk about, I occasionally think about running a scheduled backup server task just for old times sake. Thankfully so far I have been able to stop myself from doing this. Sometimes there are things that are best left as a sweet memory a bit like the original Top Gun.</p>
<p><strong><em>While you are here, take a look at some of our other </em></strong><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01"><strong><em>Backup overviews</em></strong></a><strong><em> which break down several important backup topics that may interest service providers:</em></strong></p>
