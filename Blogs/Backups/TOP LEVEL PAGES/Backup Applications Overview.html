<div data-linkz-ai-container>
<p>Backup applications is the discussion of all articles in this grouping of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backup related articles</a>.</p>
<p>Included in this group of articles is anything to do with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup clients overview">backup clients</a> storage operating systems.</p>
<p>The backup articles on applications listed below include any backup app that is either based on either a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index">local backup solution</a> or a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud based backup solution</a>.</p>
<p>We do not include backup applications that come with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">dedicated hardware</a> such as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps">Synology Network Attached Storage devices</a> or the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/quantum dxi-series backup appliances vs commvault hyperscale appliance">all in one appliances</a> such as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/oracle zero data loss recovery appliance vs acronis cyber appliance">Oracle recovery appliance</a> or the Acronis Cyber Appliance. While they do ship with a storage operating system and or a backup application included, they are categorized as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-hardware-index">backup hardware</a> and can be found here.</p>
<p><strong><em>While you are here, take a look at some of our other Backup overviews which break down several important backup topics that may interest service providers:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">Backups As A Service Overview </a></li>
<li><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup clients overview">Backup Clients Overview </a></li>
<li><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">Backup Hardware Overview </a></li>
<li><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">Backup Strategies Overview </a></li>
<li><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">Backup Vendors Overview </a></li>
<li><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">Cloud Backups Overview </a></li>
<li><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">Local Backups Overview </a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">Cloud based backup software</a> however is included in the list below and will be added to as and when new articles become available. The articles in the list below are all certified 100% human written and are not regurgitated <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/creating accessible technical documentation with chatgpt">AI junk articles</a> that I am sure most of us are sick of seeing by now. I have however used mostly <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/benefits of using chatgpt for technical documentation in managed services">artificial intelligence</a> to create the images you see, primarily because I am not the world's most artistic when it comes to images and I do not want to use other people's images on my site.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas-index">Backups As A Service</a> (BaaS) The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">invoicing schedule</a> is irrelevant and in fact most of the articles below deal with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp open source apps-index">open source applications</a>. So while your backup applications may form part of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas-index">BaaS solution</a>, they are never sold as an individual service solution.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Backup Application Types</h2>
<h4 class="display-4">Cloud Based Backup Applications</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">Cloud Based Backup Apps</a> are generally offered as part of a service by a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">backup vendor</a>. They are becoming a more dominant part of the world of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index">backup solutions</a> and while I do not think we are there yet, some say there will come a time where this is the only type of backup application required. I really am not sure that I agree with that sentiment, I believe there will always be a place for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index">local backup solutions</a>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there is a difference between <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud based applications</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">cloud based storage solutions</a> such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS S3</a> and Azure for instance.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Open Source Backup Applications</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp open source apps-index">Open Source Apps</a> are primarily used for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">locally based backups</a> on things like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">NAS drives</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/servers index">repurposed file servers</a>. There are plenty of good open source backup applications out there and many of the articles in the list above go into more detail on the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">3rd Party Backup Applications</h4>
<p>The last main category is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">third party</a> backup applications. These would be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">any application</a> that is offered aside from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">various associated hardware</a>. So if you have to purchase the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware</a> to obtain the backup application then it is not covered in the list. You can find those articles under <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">backup hardware</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/cloud apps-index">cloud based applications</a> could be included here, this is for any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">third party vendor paid backup</a> applications that do not require you to use only the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">third parties storage</a> as part of the application.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Current Articles Relating To Backup Applications</h2>
<p>Below are a selection of articles that I have chosen that are likely to be relevant to backup applications including data storage operating systems:</p>
