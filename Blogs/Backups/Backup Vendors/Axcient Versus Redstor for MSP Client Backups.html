<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient data backup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Redstor </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud backup solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be evaluated in this article, we will explore the quirks and features of both with a solid </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vendor backup recommendation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backup solutions are more important than ever, and choosing the right vendor platform can make a significant difference in terms of your reputation as an IT operations support company.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient data backup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Redstor backup offering are two </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">popular backup vendor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offerings that are fairly closely matched and are also a popular choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selecting the right backup platform that meets the unique needs of each business is one of the more important tasks of a service provider. Whether it is for small businesses or enterprise-level organizations, the right backup and recovery platform can help improve your </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/backup vendor experiences."><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup vendor experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My only piece of wisdom when it comes to online backup vendors is </span><strong>ALWAYS </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">use your own </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Something like </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS S3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure Storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It makes moving from one provider to another so much easier.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will serve as a guide for I.T organizations who are considering either </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or Redstor data backup for their clients' storage needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of this article, readers will have a reasonable understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/msp cloud backups for workstations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remote backup platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and be better equipped to make an informed decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a secondary goal of the main discussion here, I will also discuss how documentation can help IT outsourcing services manage and maintain backup and data recovery solutions effectively as it specifically relates to this topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can help you respond faster to your </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/m"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clients needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allow less experienced staff handle tasks they otherwise could not and ultimately improve your profit margins while getting ahead of your competition.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical publication processes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be corporate backup solutions discussed here or recording how your support desk undertakes a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/is billing clients to test backups normal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">test backup and restores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consistently. It enables IT operations support to manage and maintain the infrastructure of their clients effectively.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have years of experience in working with service providers to </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">document their procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; and as mentioned, there is no area more important to a service provider than how their clients' backup and disaster recovery systems are documented.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient Vs Redstor</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary difference between Axcient and Redstor is that Redstor has a very </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud-based backup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focus whereas Axcient offers both </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on-premise backup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solutions as well as cloud-based backup solutions that work together. Of course there are various backup plans from each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both backup solutions target I.T outsourcing partners and are designed for this purpose in mind. Now anyone that has read my other articles on backup systems knows that I believe the best backup systems require both an online and local component.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient goes to great lengths to state their local component is a cache not an actual local backup so this needs to be taken into consideration. It still needs the online backup to work and keeps the large lump of data locally so the restores can be reduced in time taken but you cannot spin up a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/virtual machine index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Machine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> straight from the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/asustor drivestor 4 vs  asustor drivestor 4 pro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local backed up copy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient Backup Key Features</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Axcient backup offering has several benefits that get me a bit excited.These include:</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Based With Local Cache</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient is primarily focused on cloud backups yet does still have the capability to store a local copy of your </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clients backup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information using either a BYOD or a Axcient supplied device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They go to great pain to mention that the local backup is only a cache storage with its primary reason for existing, to reduce the time required to undertake a full recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient backup also claims to have a &ldquo;Bring Your Own Datacenter&rdquo; which is a fancy way of saying that the backup solution will work with other cloud providers.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">File Level and System level Backups</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient allows for both file-level and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">system image backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">File-level</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> backups enable the protection of individual files and folders, while system image backups capture an entire system, including the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operating system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While providing image based backups is a great feature, you need to consider how big and how many servers will be part of the backup. It requires capacity planning and the ability to keep a local copy of the cloud based data is a big advantage.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backup Virtualization</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient supports the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud virtualization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of backed-up systems, enabling businesses to quickly spin up virtual instances of their systems for testing, recovery, or temporary operations during downtime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now this feature could conceivably be used as a replacement for </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/nas vs san"><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally based backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It eliminates the requirement for having to transport the backups to the client location. Just start the backed up server image from the backup location and your clients staff can work in a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remote capacity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may be licensing and practicality issues regarding this but it certainly goes a long way to making the argument that companies could eliminate their local backup storage systems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransomware Detection</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient comes with built in </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/mssp overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ransomware functionality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and this is such a welcome inclusion because there have certainly been some high profile </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ransomware incidents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the recent past where the backup was rendered useless because the hackers targeted the backups in the leadup to the actual hack taking place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worthy Mentions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With other features albeit standard in many backup solutions including Automated backup scheduling, Centralized management and some decent reporting functionality, the Axcient backup solution has me Big Kev excited.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient Backup Disadvantages</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also some drawbacks to using Axcient. These include:</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer Support Complaints</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the product itself is quite good, there have been quite a few complaints about customer support. This type of disadvantage can change rapidly so it would be best to do a bit of searching to see if the company has listened and rectified long delays and over-use of cheap overseas level one support.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is annoying when a company puts very </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inexperienced techs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the front line when they know the callers will be likely </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced technicians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who have already done in 5 mins what it takes a day for level 1 to work through before escalation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**I have worked with some great help desks that operate in places like the Philippines and the good ones are scary good however if an organization lets price dictate choices, things can go bad fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendor Lock In</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are locked in to the Axcient which can be a little frustrating especially if the relationship breaks down. One way to avoid this is to ensure you only use your own cloud storage in the form of either another vendor or your </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self managed cloud storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online backup solutions are actually quite labor intensive to move away from so this should always be taken into consideration when signing up.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backup Plan Creep</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can get expensive fast depending on your needs. The flipside of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/should msps backup google workspace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud backup plan scalability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the touch of a button is that it is just as simple for the backup vendor to swipe your credit card with the extra cost involved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non Intuitive Management Console</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There can be a steep learning curve and because of the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lack of intuitiveness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I kept having to google the same questions over again. The errors also do not seem to be all that transparent or intuitive.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redstor Backup Key Features</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redstor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another popular backup solution that offers a range of features to protect businesses from data loss. Some of the key features of Redstor include:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">eDiscovery and Compliance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redstor backup offers General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which mainly would be of interest to our </span><a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2020/03/27/gdpr-in-the-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">European readers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it can ensure you remain compliant under that framework.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also offer a fairly centralized way of monitoring your clients backed up data via </span><a href="https://app.redstor.com/sign-in"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RedApp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that you can stay on top of erasing information as regulations require as well as making e-discovery requests more painless than they otherwise would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It really does make the task of deleting and archiving client data (as requested through them) automated reducing the chance of mistakes occurring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also opens the opportunity for service providers to bill for something above and beyond the standard backup and recovery services normally on offer. Many businesses need to employ a dedicated staff member just to keep on top of these sorts of issues and you can come in like the hero you are and offer this type of service for a handsome (yet dignified) fee.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">InstantData</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.redstor.com/our-technology/instantdata/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redstor's InstantData</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature allows for near-instant access to backups, even if the original data is no longer available. It means you can view any file any time. It is a feature that certainly gets me a little excited that is for sure.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geo-redundant Storage</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redstor offers </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups"><span style="font-weight: 400;">geo-redundant storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means that backups are stored in multiple locations to ensure that data is always available. This would be a worthwhile feature for anyone living in a hurricane or tornado zone where it is possible an entire city could be impacted by an event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By having geo redundancy, you get a copy of your clients backed up data in your own region with the benefit of it being also distributed to other geographical areas.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Storage and Local Backup Capabilities</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where Redstor takes the lead over Axcient. It is difficult to overcome the advantage that Redstor has in that it provides a complete </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate cloud solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and feature rich </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Local Copies With Consolidation and Retention</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can keep </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/choosing an msp backup solution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple backup copies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the ability to collapse backups into rollups means you can limit the amount of space required. You are limited only by the space you allocate for backups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These backups can be stored either on a local computer, removable drive or UNC (Used for </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/server vs nas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Network Attached Storage Devices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) Think of how ShadowProtect used to work with imaging and consolidation and you get the picture.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous Data Protection</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redstors CDP feature ensures that backups are performed continuously, capturing every change made to the protected data. This minimizes data loss and allows for quick recovery to any point in time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worthy Mentions&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redstor uses deduplication to reduce the amount of data that needs to be backed up, which can save time and storage space. Redstor also has the usual features expected in a service provider backup offering such as centralized management, competent backup reporting and the ability to migrate data from other platforms.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redstor Backup Disadvantages</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is only one real drawback using Redstor Backups.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expensive</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redstor is at the higher end of subscription fees although as they say you tend to get what you pay for.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verdict</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axcient and Redstor both offer decent solutions for </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/inheriting existing msp backups"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSP client backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Redstor comes out on top in my view. When you take into account the archive capabilities and automated ability to adhere to compliance and add that to the way it provides such a comprehensive way to handle the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local backup versions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is the winner here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also has technical support that is at a higher level than Axcient. It all comes at a cost though and if you do go down the Redstor route then you had better have access to large sweaty wads of cash.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both options are good solutions for anyone looking to invest in the very best backup and recovery solutions on the market today. We hope this article has provided you with a solid foundation and understanding of this topic.</span></p>
