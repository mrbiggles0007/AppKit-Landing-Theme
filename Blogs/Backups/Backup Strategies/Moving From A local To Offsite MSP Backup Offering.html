<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onsite backups at one point were about the only option for I.T outsourcing services to provide </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup coverage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was our best effort and we had to trust designated </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">client staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to take </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removable USB drives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/do tape based backups still have a place today"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tape offsite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> each night. Gradually services started to creep in where outsourced companies would take on the responsibility of taking the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/best effort and msp liability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offsite each night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never considered it a very reliable system but back in the 90s it was all we had. I will be discussing the need to move your clients' backups to the cloud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I strongly believe this is not an either or situation, </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/testing client backups &amp; restores"><span style="font-weight: 400;">competent service providers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should only be offering backup solutions that include both an on-site backup and off-site backup component in this day and age.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a secondary goal of the main topic, I will also discuss how documentation can help IT consulting services manage and maintain projects such as a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local backup migration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project discussed in this article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical publications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be storage solutions discussed here or the steps involved documenting the handling of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/monitoring backups for non agreement clients"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non agreement clients</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An effective record keeping routine enables IT consulting advisors to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their clients far more effectively.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasons To Consider Online&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud backups the best</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;, is something I hear quite often. It is not that simple. A service provider should be combining an online component to their existing backup offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps you have just started an MSP and the options have become overwhelming, maybe you have some clients that came to you when they were small and the solution of a removable </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/computer peripherals index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USB drive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was working but you are seeing all of the angles where that could fail and want to supply a more </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/should we backup cloud apps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">robust backup plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are a couple of likely many reasons. If you are serious about offering a great backup service to your clients then I believe you need to trim the fat and no </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d76CwsWbV2E"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do not mean getting rid of the fat people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Get rid of any </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you do not stand behind.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achilles Heal Of Service Provider Backup Plans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering 32 different tiers of backup plans can be tempting. It means you have a much larger net to catch potential clients that want to spend the minimum and also the clients that understand the value of a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/testing client backups &amp; restores"><span style="font-weight: 400;">premium backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t do it, just think of what Chef Ramsay </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY3tv-y62A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as you show him your comically long menu. Spend time investigating the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client expectations on enterprise backup solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best backup plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you can for your clients and offer only one set of features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very important when moving from a local to onsite backup strategy that you take the time to evaluate what you offer that currently works and what you should discard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main problem with offering too many choices when it comes to backups is that it is easy to forget who is on what plan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope we all understand that when we put two backup plans side by side with one being half the price, that going for the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/inheriting existing msp backups"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheap backup plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means that as a provider you have accepted that in certain circumstances, your client is not covered and they will lose their company data in a larger number of possible scenarios than the expensive one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do your best to relay this to the client and ideally obtain a signature detailing what is offered to protect yourself. While that may protect you from the courts, it is not going to protect the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients"><span style="font-weight: 400;">client relationship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is only one thing more infuriating for a client than their technology partner being unable to recover valuable data and that is being unable to recover the data and proving without a doubt that it is their own fault they are in that situation. You are going to lose the client and that is why I recommend only offering the best backup solution you possibly can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before looking at the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best cloud backup solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, lets commit to offering only one backup plan that includes both a local recovery component and a hosted recovery component. You will sleep easier and be more confident in the offerings you provide.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Available Offsite Backup Solutions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There really is such a huge number of companies offering service providers their version of offsite backup solutions. I have had personal experience with a number of these and trust me just because it is a big well known organization, it does not mean their offering is any good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember back when I had spent around 80K on Kaseya VSA licenses and part of that was I decided to purchase about $7000 worth of Kaseya endpoint security licenses. I did not investigate because they were a large company and their VSA was a reasonable product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well I got that wrong, 7K and they never worked or should I say, they caused so many issues with client machines that my organization's reputation was actually impacted by it. Ultimately I deserved it because I had not tested them prior to committing. </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaseya&rsquo;s response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was to admit it was a terrible product and offer a 10% discount if I purchased the new ESET version that reportedly fixed the problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a big lesson in my habit of trusting providers just because they are well known and large.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So while I have had experience with the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud backup solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> below, do not take my word for it and it is your responsibility to fully test the potential solution you would like to offer your clients. That action will separate you from many of the others out there that see themselves as service providers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acronis Cyber Appliance</span></h3>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Verdict</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving from a local to offsite MSP backup offering is an important step to ensure the safety and security of their </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client backup verification process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clients' data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As mentioned it is not an either or option as far as deciding if local backup solutions such as a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/5 benefits of a synology backup for msps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synology NAS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are no longer needed, I believe you need both for an effective recovery strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offsite backup solutions however offer a range of benefits that augment an existing physical backup solution, including better protection against disasters, enhanced data security, and the ability to </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managed service provider backups - client expectations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly restore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small amounts of data in the event of a disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, using existing offerings from some of the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading vendors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help ensure that your backups are being stored and managed effectively but you need to ensure you investigate and test the claims they make as well as explore the voracity and number of current </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave"><span style="font-weight: 400;">client complaints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regarding any solution you look into.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/monitoring backups for non agreement clients"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliable backup and recovery solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is complex especially once you start considering </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online backup solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is possible to eliminate all </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/freenas vs truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local backup components</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from your backup offering, I think we can all agree that it would mean compromising the quality and reliability of your offering in the quest to offer something cheaper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding an offsite backup component to your existing disaster recovery plans is the way to go. Yes the extra cost will turn some potential clients away however it's probably for the best. Stick with the best backup and recovery solution you can design and the ones that do not appreciate that, hand them the business card of your competition.</span></p>
