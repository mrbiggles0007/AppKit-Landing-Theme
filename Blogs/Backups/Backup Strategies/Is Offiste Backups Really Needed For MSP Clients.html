<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSP backup solutions have changed drastically over the last decade or so. Data is one of the most valuable assets of any business, and as custodians of business information in the form of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/best effort and msp liability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">client backup management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is our job to ensure we do everything within our power to ensure when the time comes, our clients can rely on us to make sure a bad day does not end up much worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been such a tectonic </span><a href="https://mediapeanut.com/how-fast-is-technology-growing-statistics-facts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">change in technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and with that </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business backup strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the last decade. Many of us that were doing </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">technical support in the 90s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> probably have a tough time shifting our mindset to a place where relying on offsite backups could be a conceivable reality and yet here we are.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I admit to still cleaning up my office files to ensure I do not </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aYat9357mE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">run out of space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on my hard disk and the amount of information thrown across the average data connection these days still blows my mind and yet the new generation probably never gives it a second thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This does present a problem in the form of inertia for even the most talented yet </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maturing technical people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who are both happy and horrified that they are actually starting to think about accessing their 401(k) plans where because of our experience, we may still be questioning the robustness as to if </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud based backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be fully relied on to competently backup our clients business information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in this article, I will be discussing how I think offsite cloud backups, both self hosted and </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vendor hosted cloud based backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stack up against say the reliable </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/is asustor better than synology"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synology NAS appliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that has always done a pretty good job on its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may be a few of you reading that still either use </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/do tape based backups still have a place today"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tape based backup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> systems or a rotation of </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removable USB drives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that someone is designated to take off site each night and I will also touch on those.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a secondary goal of the main discussion here, I will also discuss how documentation can help IT consulting services manage and maintain backup and data recovery solutions including the range of offsite backups solutions available today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a near infinite number of sites discussing every subject to do with being a service provider yet I have rarely seen an organization attempt to assist providers in applying a workable documentation framework. I make no apology for weaving a few tips about documentation as it relates to this topic here and there.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be offsite backup strategies or the steps involved on how to </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/communicating backup retention policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicate your retention policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are that your competition consistently </span><a href="https://www.itglue.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Global_Benchmark_2019_FINAL-N.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outperforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PDF link) you in areas such as ticket completion times and number of tickets resolved in a day not because they are more </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">technically proficient</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than you but because they have an </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">effective documentation strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in place.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offsite Backup Meaning</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to outline when a MSP backup is not considered an off site backup as there are gray areas we need to address so that we are all on the same page as far as definition. The table below will outline the framework for this article.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will consider any backup with the primary connection being a self installed </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/cables &amp; adapters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RJ-45 cable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of less than 300 feet to be a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local based backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the backup solution resides within the same building as the data you are backing up regardless as to the connection type then we will consider it an </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/asustor drivestor 4 vs  asustor drivestor 4 pro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onsite backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and not a remote backup solution.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do You Need An Offsite Backup?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically there is no requirement in many businesses to have an offsite backup solution although more mature market segments such as health and finance have regulation in place to ensure it occurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In businesses without regulation, you could offer your clients a backup solution based on taking removable drives or tapes off site and you would only be considered mildly irresponsible because regardless of what I or anyone else thinks, it offers a solution that satisfies the clients risk profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MLM organizations and </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Lorenz-curves-of-a-sample-of-Ponzi-schemes_fig3_335033537"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pyramid schemes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continue to flourish today and their growth makes Moore's law look like an amateur. if the business is unregulated then those lacking in moral fiber will prey on those that do not know any better. Just like people will always chase the idea of getting rich quick, people will always pick the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managed service provider backups - client expectations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheapest backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if offered to them. People underestimate the chances of bad things happening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most popular and</span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> profitable backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be one that does nothing yet is the cheapest, because nobody cares until they need it and they think they will never need it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the old days I would get clients that would always believe nothing bad would ever happen and so saw the cost of a backup as a waste of money. I would get into a situation where they would opt for the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/is billing clients to test backups normal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheapest backup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they could choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That situation never worked long term because even though it was their decision, as the provider, you will be blamed if they cannot obtain their </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Clients are not interested in complexity, you offer them a backup that is substandard, they will take it because it's the cheapest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best solution here is not to offer any </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will not cover all but the most </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unlikely disaster recovery scenarios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and to do that your offerings must all include an offsite backup component.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not doing so in this day and age is the hallmark of an </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unprofessional service provider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was offering offsite backups back when I </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">started my own MSP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it was a lot harder to offer it back then so anyone not providing them these days has no excuse in my book. If a potential client does not want to spend the money on a backup solution that includes an online component then you should walk away.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Backups Too Expensive?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of online backups is something you can see coming and can budget for. Compare that to the situation where you have to advise a client of yours that may well have been paying for backup services for perhaps years and never needed to rely on it until now and then having to advise them that their </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/list of high profile backup failures by msps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data cannot be recovered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backup solutions are also not an on/off situation. OK so your clients may be</span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client refuses recommended backup solution"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unwilling to pay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for an all inclusive backup solution however you could perhaps decide to only backup their user drives and profiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, that is what I used to do when it was much more difficult however in today's market, I would not offer any solution that does not include a comprehensive </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/testing client backups &amp; restores"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online incremental backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Backups - Cheaper?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They say that online backups are more cost effective than </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/is cloud storage a viable alternative to nas storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">traditional local backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I am not sure we are there yet, there will come a time when this is true however we need to take into account the economies of scale at work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My view is that if you are a small business or individual then your requirements are low and using a cloud solution for all of your needs will likely cost very little and could well be an effective backup solution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not strictly classed as a backup, you could use </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MS Onedrive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/should msps backup google workspace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Drive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and these will give a little bit of protection if set up correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a service provider, offsite backups can be a far more expensive proposition and certainly backing up to a level that gives the client close to 100% coverage is not going to be cheap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the type of organization, your clients may have so much information to backup that unless you provide them expensive dedicated internet links, there may not be enough hours in the day to complete a successful backup no matter how efficient the compression techniques are.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backup Scalability&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online backups do have the advantage of being more scalable. Most </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud backup providers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have the capacity to provide increased resources from their end as long as your internet link can handle the throughput.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs rapidly increase as your needs increase and it requires some careful planning especially for larger organizations so that the costs do not become excessive.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Backup Disadvantages</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Backup Speed</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed is the largest disadvantage when it comes to a remote backup solution. Speed in both directions so backing up is only half of the equation. When it comes to a situation where an organization needs to put their </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable is your msp for a data breach"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disaster recovery plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into action, the pressure can be immense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advising the client that &ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">it's all good, we will have your 200 staff up and running within 4 business days</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; while the 1 terabyte of server images download is not going to go down very well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My advice here is to engage a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local cloud backup provider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if possible, a company that has a presence and datacenters in the same city as you and your client are located. It means the worst case scenario is you would have to hop in the car and obtain a copy rather than waiting on the postman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations that live in known hurricane paths or other areas where there are risks that could impact an entire city may need to look at risking the slow turnaround in recovery or invest more in having </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising facts about managed backups with managed service providers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple offsite backups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cover those scenarios.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendor Lock In</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the way online backups work, it requires a lot of overhead to get the backups to a point where they are doing an incremental backup in a timely fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes there is time invested in posting the initial backup as it may be much faster depending on the amount of information that needs to be backed up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can take a lot of organization and time and so realistically you experience </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vendor lock in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If another vendor comes out with the latest feature or your existing vendor has </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poor technical support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then the pain inflicted before you can consider leaving is much higher.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack Of Control</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you sign up with a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud backup vendor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you are reliant on them to be professional and ensure they react within reasonable time frames.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your clients are relying on you to ensure their information is backed up and you can do all the checks to ensure it works OK however if the vendor disappears, goes out of business or puts their hands up and says &ldquo;sorry it looks like we cannot recover your clients information&rdquo; when that critical moment arrives then it is going to be a very bad day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a risk that you cannot totally eliminate and it is a risk that is not a factor when you have a toasty warm </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/truenas vs  esos %E2%80%93 enterprise storage os"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliable TrueNAS device</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sitting under your desk quietly going about its business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verdict</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The verdict is that offsite backups in this day and age are absolutely required for any backup plan offered by a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management"><span style="font-weight: 400;">competent service provider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offsite backups should be used in conjunction with a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliable local automated backup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solution such as</span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Veeam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coupled with a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/truenas vs rockstor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockstor NAS device</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or perhaps an </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/oracle zero data loss recovery appliance vs acronis cyber appliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acronis Cyber Appliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for this is that a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/freenas vs truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will give you the speed and coverage to restore the vast majority of user/application information that may form part of a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/legal hold and retention policies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restore request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the clients timeframe expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The online backup component should complement a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/nas4free vs truenas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local backup strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all but the smallest companies. Many service providers will mix and match however there are a number of solutions out there now that will offer both in an all in </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/hpe storeonce backup appliance vs barracuda backup appliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one backup appliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So to give a car analogy, instead of going to Corvette and buying the drive train then going to Jeep to purchase the body and interior before attempting to make the two halves work nicely together, you go to a single vendor and buy the entire car taking comfort in the knowledge it has been already put together and tested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your budget allows and your clients are willing to invest in an all in one backup unit such as </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/hpe greenlake vs dell apex"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HPE Greenlake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then that would be my recommendation because rather than trying to integrate and get two separate solutions working, you purchase a backup unit that does both so that it gives you total coverage.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering a reliable backup and recovery solution is complex. While you can buy an </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/oracle zero data loss recovery appliance vs acronis cyber appliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">off the shelf backup solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a number of forms, there will always be risks involved. Being able to convey this to the client without losing the sale can be tough and it may be tempting to lower your price by eliminating features you know the potential client needs.</span></p>
