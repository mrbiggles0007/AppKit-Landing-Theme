<h2 class="display-6">Pace Of Current Technology</h2>
<p>There are few times in history where technology has moved forward at such a rapid pace. With the advent of AI which often feels like magic, it is hard not to get a bit carried away with it.</p>
<p>It is easy to think that AI in general is pretty much going to impact the world much the same way the USB connector or the computer itself &amp; I think in general, that is a correct view, especially considering we are right at the start of this &amp; the improvement curve is so steep already.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Impact On Managed Service Providers</h2>
<p>Like any new tool though, it is just a tool to make things easier. Ask yourself, what does AI need to be able to function?</p>
<p>It needs input from humans, without that, it fails to be useful for anything beyond interpreting history. It still needs ongoing unique content from human beings to be able to appear as if it has all the answers.</p>
<p>If humans stopped uploading unique content built on our individual experience then cloud based AI is incapable of generating new worthwhile and unique content that we can learn from.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Versus Google Search Engine</h2>
<p>It is likely it is going to supersede Google as far as search tools though./span></p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, Google went from a very useful tool to being just a popularity contest where the large corporations automatically receive the highest vote from Google even if the content they spew up on the first few pages is not relevant in any way to what you are looking for. ChatGPT for instance appears far more impartial to the information it delivers.</p>
<p>Look at any halfway popular search term and you find yourself having to wade through the first 40 results that have almost no relevance to what you are searching for to get the answers you want.</p>
<p>I just hope the new Google ChatGPT tool does not put a stranglehold on ChatGPT and start delivering non relevant information that steers us towards information engineered by the top corporations.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Google Diversification</h2>
<p>Still, Google has diversified so much that the search engine itself could disappear and they will continue to maintain their dominance. They probably saw the AI revolution before many of us.</p>
<p>As a tool for documentation though, it is both extremely promising in eliminating some of the more mundane areas required in a successful documentation framework deployment.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Limitations</h2>
<p>AI chatgpt is not going to implement a successful flexible asset framework though, it's not going to put in a consistent password naming convention and ensure it remains relevant. If you asked it to configure and integrate your various systems, you will be very disappointed.</p>
<p>There is a long list of important tasks that AI as a tool is not capable of undertaking. As history teaches us, it will enable us to do more in less time and somewhere along the way, we will look back and find we will be working harder on more complex tasks than we ever did before.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Strengths</h2>
<p>I love AI and I use it for what it is good at and that for me is overcoming creative blocks and giving me ideas &amp; yes sometimes it just blows me away at how much better it is at getting points across. Is this written using AI? No, these thoughts so far are written 100% by a human being with over 25 years experience working in the MSP space.</p>
<p>I do use it for those circumstances where I need to extract my expertise onto the screen, so for example, I might have 5 good reasons why Managed service providers should consider using a 3rd party to undertake their documentation refresh project and it will prompt me for another 5 or 10 reasons.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Consistency</h2>
<p>Several areas that make AI appear so human yet also are big disadvantages when it comes to having an effective &amp; competitive documentation framework is first, how terrible it handles consistency.</p>
<p>It is randomly and constantly inconsistent. You could say that is a type of consistency I suppose however as an example, give it an identical prompt across say 5 technical documents for something as simple as using H2 Headings for each section heading.</p>
<p>It will do exactly as you ask it for 2 of those documents and then ignore your prompt for the remaining 3. You then ask it 15 different ways for headings that you know work while it apologises for its mistake and yet fails to correct it.</p>
<p>Leave it a day, put in the original prompt in the same chat and watch as it follows it to a tee.</p>
