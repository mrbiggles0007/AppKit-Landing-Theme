<p>This is the overview of ChatGPT specifically targeted at MSPs who want to use it for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">technical documentation</a>, however I want to really discuss something that many no doubt are thinking of doing and that is use ChatGPT to write their own articles or autonomously create <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">technical documentation</a>.</p>

<div data-linkz-ai-container>
<p>There are few times in history where technology has moved forward at such a rapid pace. With the advent of AI which often feels like magic, it is hard not to get a bit carried away with it.</p>
<p>It is easy to think that AI in general is pretty much going to impact the world much the same way the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">USB connector</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">desktop PC</a> itself &amp; I think in general, that is a correct view, especially considering we are right at the start of this &amp; the improvement curve is so steep already.</p>
<p>While I have used <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/chatgpt msp general - index">Artificial intelligence offline</a> to assist with an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">MSP documentation framework</a> with which I write documentation, I attempted to use it to write public facing articles on a range of technology focused topics and it has been an unmitigated disaster.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-danger bg-gradient text-white rounded rounded-3 overflow-hidden"><strong>WARNING:</strong> I am one eighth of the way through rectifying the dreadful mess that I have created so please do not look at any other ChatGPT articles listed as they are all currently still written by AI.</div>
<p>I spend about 3 hours per article and get maybe 2 articles completed per day if I am lucky. I suspect I will have replaced all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for generating documentation for complex technical systems">AI articles</a> with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to improve the accuracy and consistency of your technical documentation">human written content</a> within 4 months but it is a slow process.</p>
<p>I am keeping the pages there because one thing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for it infrastructure">AI does really well</a> is the ability to help me structure. The pages all exist which means as I link from one page to another, that page is easily linked too. It is like the chicken and the egg in this manner in that I could take them all offline however I would then no longer be able to link to them.</p>
<p>So far keeping them up does not seem to cause any issues and whenever I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for collaboration between technical writers and subject matter experts">re-submit an article</a>, they are both re-indexed and served on Google within a few hours.</p>
<p>I have completed a single category which is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">MSP Backup category</a> so if that floats your boat then it is the one category I guarantee has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to improve the accuracy and consistency of your technical documentation">100% human written content</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/chatgpt msp general - index">experience with ChatGPT</a> and how my view or perception of it went from basically a type of magic to now 6 months later thinking that while it is great for certain specific tasks, ChatGPT articles are complete junk that insults the intelligence of people such as yourself that have taken time out of their day to read an article that they believe has unique content where at the end, there is a feeling that something has been gained from reading it.</p>
<p>Agree or disagree, a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to improve the accuracy and consistency of your technical documentation">human written article</a> will make you think about whatever subject you are reading about and come out of it the other side better than you went in.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Images</h2>
<p>While I am eliminating, albeit slowly, every <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/creating accessible technical documentation with chatgpt">AI written article</a> on my site, I have used <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation for non-technical audiences">AI to create images</a> you see here. I did that for several reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I do not think they are all that important because most people come here to help solve an issue or understand a particular problem to do with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">service provider documentation management</a>, the pictures are just there to break up the text into manageable chunks.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am not the world's most creative individual, I know enough about <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">Photoshop</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp application stacks-index-page">Indesign</a> to just get by and AI does a better job than I could ever do creating images.</p>
<p>Third, I do not want to use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">copyrighted images</a> or other peoples material here and so having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation for non-technical audiences">AI create the images</a> eliminates the risk of using other people's material.</p>
<p>Finally, I am a huge fan of the gaudy dripping psychedelic look of the images on here and I could never replicate them on my own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary you will find over 95% of my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation for non-technical audiences">images are created with AI tools</a> (Except screenshots) however I can take credit for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/diagrams-index-page-01">resizing and cropping</a> the images as well as changing them over to the newer <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/diagram how to-index-page">web image format</a> and that has to count for something don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Impact On Managed Service Providers</h2>
<p>Like any new tool though, it is just a tool to make things easier. Ask yourself, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation that aligns with brand voice and tone">what does AI need to be able to function</a>?</p>
<p>It needs input from humans, without that, it fails to be useful for anything beyond interpreting history. It still needs ongoing unique content from human beings to be able to appear as if it has all the answers.</p>
<p>If humans stopped uploading unique content built on our individual experience then <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud based</a> AI is incapable of generating new worthwhile and unique content that we can learn from.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Creation Of My Website</h2>
<p>This site you are reading is less than 6 months old at the time of writing this article and I spent the first 3 weeks designing a mother beautiful <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">spreadsheet</a> with all of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">keywords</a> I wanted to use along with variation of terms etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then after creating the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for generating technical documentation for both internal and external use">perfect AI prompt</a> that I believed would encapsulate my experience and demonstrate I am the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">guru of MSP documentation</a>, I instructed ChatGPT to write 300 articles on various <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">MSP topics of interest.</a></p>
<p>I wrote those 300 articles while <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">watching Youtube</a>, I didn't even really read what it was writing. On the surface it appeared to be doing a better job of writing than I ever could.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, I have always struggled with the creativity required to write well and I am embarrassed at the amount of times I tend to just stare at a screen for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>So I created these 300 articles and uploaded them to my site eagerly submitting them in batches of about 20 a day already patting myself on the back. Guess what Google did?</p>
<p>It indexed the lot and my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/how to integrate chatgpt into your existing technical documentation process for managed services">article impressions</a> quickly shot up to about 600 a day and thought I had hit the big time.</p>
<p>Within a short time frame however, the impressions on Google had dropped like a stone, from 600 down to around 100 per day. Why could that have been?</p>
<p>Take a look at the image below, it demonstrates how early on, most of my pages were indexed initially yet as time went on they gradually de-indexed before I rewrote them causing them to be reindexed in a very short amount of time.</p>
<a href="/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/how to integrate chatgpt into your existing technical documentation process for managed services"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../../assets/images/blog/blog-functional-images/chatgpt/Google Search Console Trend.webp" alt="Impressions Of Articles"></a>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Versus Google Search Engine</h2>
<p>It is likely it is going to supersede Google as far as search tools though./span&gt;</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, Google went from a very useful tool to being just a popularity contest where the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01">large corporations</a> automatically receive the highest vote from Google even if the content they spew up on the first few pages is not relevant in any way to what you are looking for. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/chatgpt msp general - index">ChatGPT</a> for instance appears far more impartial to the information it delivers.</p>
<p>Look at any halfway popular search term and you find yourself having to wade through the first 40 results that have almost no relevance to what you are searching for to get the answers you want.</p>
<p>I just hope the new <a href="https://bard.google.com/">Google Bard tool</a> does not put a stranglehold on ChatGPT and start delivering non relevant information that steers us towards information engineered by the top corporations.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Google Diversification</h2>
<p>Still, Google has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">diversified</a> so much that the search engine itself could disappear and they will continue to maintain their dominance. They probably saw the AI revolution before many of us.</p>
<p>As a tool for documentation though, it is both extremely promising in eliminating some of the more mundane areas required in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">successful documentation framework deployment</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Artificial Intelligence Writes Superficial Junk</h2>
<p>When I first started <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/training chatgpt to generate documentation that aligns with your companys brand and tone">creating articles using AI</a>, I noticed on the surface it would come across as impressive throwing words like &ldquo;<em>Crucial</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Delve In</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>critical</em>&rdquo; . It was awesome, I legitimately thought it was the closest to magic I had come across.</p>
<p>I am fairly new to creating a blog and I was just expecting the numbers to continue to go through the roof and when they didn&rsquo;t, I thought perhaps I better have a quick read of the articles just to make sure they were of adequate quality&hellip;.</p>
<p>Take a look at the image that shows how I got an initial boost before my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/generating technical documentation for artificial intelligence with chatgpt">articles' impressions</a> just fell away.</p>
<a href="/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/generating technical documentation for artificial intelligence with chatgpt"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../../assets/images/blog/blog-functional-images/chatgpt/ChatGPT Article Replacement1.webp" alt="technical documentation for artificial intelligence with chatgpt"></a>
<br></br>
<p>The image below is a zoom in on the image above showing more detail. The time frame is over 5 months and as you can see all documents were initally indexed before quickly falling away. This is a direct result of rewriting AI generated documentation</p>
<a href="/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to improve the accuracy and consistency of your technical documentation"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../../assets/images/blog/blog-functional-images/chatgpt/ChatGPT Article Replacement2.webp" alt="Content written by human beings"></a>
<br></br>
<p>I am not sure if in your life you have come across something so confronting that you cannot absorb it all at once so you say to yourself &ldquo;<em>it's not that bad</em>&rdquo; while deep down knowing it is?</p>
<p>Well that is how I handled things, I read a few <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backup articles</a> and thought I could just edit them to make them more useful and readable. Gradually over a period of a week or so and having adjusted a few, I realized that every part of the articles were trash and most of the time after reading 1500 words I would get to the end and think &ldquo;<em>What did I just read?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Articles Need To Be Useful</h2>
<p>AI can create 1500 word articles in less than a minute but they are awful and not only does <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/the impact of chatgpt on the speed and efficiency of technical documentation creation">AI needlessly</a> take 20 words to say something that only needs 5, it <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/benefits of using chatgpt for technical documentation in managed services">repeats the same phrases</a> over and over again.</p>
<p>Google as it turns out just like AI <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for generating technical documentation for different delivery methods">cannot actually read an article</a>, it cannot give it a <a href="http://www.dougdemuro.com/dougscore">Doug score</a> but as it turns out, it doesn&rsquo;t need to. If you upload junk then people will read a couple of sentences and back out of the page. Google then uses those analytics to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">determine if the content is worthwhile</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out, it is the single most important part of creating web content, it has to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/how to use chatgpt to create technical documentation that is accessible to people with disabilities">useful to the reader</a>, who would have thought?</p>
<p>Chat gpt is not going to implement a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">successful flexible asset framework</a> though, it's not going to put in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">consistent password naming convention</a> and ensure it remains relevant. If you asked it to configure and integrate your various systems, you will be very disappointed.</p>
<p>There is a long list of important tasks that AI as a tool is not capable of undertaking. As history teaches us, it will enable us to do more in less time and somewhere along the way, we will look back and find we will be working harder on more complex tasks than we ever did before.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Articles That Are Of No Use</h2>
<p>Over half of my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/chatgpt msp general - index">articles created with ChatGPT</a> are still indexed with Google and still bring in a little traffic, however the reason Google is de-indexing these pages is because they are of no use to readers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They do not add anything useful to any conversation, they just <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/limitations of chatgpt for technical writing">regurgitate information</a> that is already out there in a way that most often makes little sense at all.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">New Article Writing Strategy</h2>
<p>When I started down this path, I was hyper defensive regarding anyone telling me that articles written with AI are a waste of time because it meant having to confront the fact I had not suddenly discovered a path of fast money and no effort, something I have always been unsuccessful at. I am almost starting to believe that anything worthwhile requires effort which admittedly is a bit of a bummer. There is no market for the bathwater of middle aged men unfortunately.</p>
<p>Now like a reformed smoker, I am ecstatic that ChatGPT and others like it <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/limitations of chatgpt for technical writing">cannot take the place of human writers</a>. The very fact it makes it so easy to write an article means the bar is lowered so that everyone can participate even non english writers and that is actually a bad thing.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/the impact of chatgpt on the quality of technical documentation for managed services">AI writes articles so poorly</a> it means that people are going to get sick to death pretty quickly of AI generated content unless it is something of utility such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">AI written powershell scripts</a>. Every man and his dog is currently doing it and that just makes <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to improve the accuracy and consistency of your technical documentation">human written</a> content even more valuable.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">The Future Of AI</h2>
<p>AI is here and right now is the worst it is going to ever be, it will only ever improve from this point forward. I cannot see it taking away writers especially in specialized fields like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">MSP information management and deduplication</a>. We currently live in a time with the best of both worlds where we can use AI to undertake the mundane stuff.</p>
<p>For instance, I have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for generating documentation for complex technical systems">local trained copy</a> that I use to help write technical documentation. It is currently far from perfect and the mistakes it makes often mean it is actually easier to do something manually.</p>
<p>It cannot take the place of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">MSP documentation specialists</a> and I cannot see it ever doing that or at least not in the near future. You will still need <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff expertise</a> to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">write the documentation</a> however what it does do is forces <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">technically competent staff</a> to work within a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">framework of documentation rules</a> and that does help.</p>
<p>It helps a great deal in areas where previously I had failed which is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">enforcing consistency</a> over a long time frame.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Should Search Engines Ban AI Content?</h2>
<p>I do not think they should. I think they are doing it right in this department. An article should not be penalized just because of the way it was created. If someone is able to create a useful article that people benefit from then who cares how it was created?</p>
<p>By <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/measure the effectiveness of chatgpt in creating technical documentation for managed services">evaluating the usefulness the article</a> brings to readers is the best way to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/the role of chatgpt in improving the customer experience through better technical documentation">evaluate an article</a>, it keeps the playing field level. I am actually really thankful that as things stand, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/tips for editing and reviewing technical documentation generated by chatgpt">AI is not capable</a> of writing a helpful article because it means the effort I am putting in here is not wasted.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Strengths</h2>
<p>It sounds as if <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation that aligns with brand voice and tone">I hate AI</a> however <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/how to measure the effectiveness of chatgpt in creating technical documentation for managed services">I love AI</a> and I use it for what it is good at and that for me is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for customer support and service">overcoming creative blocks</a> and giving me ideas.</p>
<p>I do use it for those circumstances where I need to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">extract my expertise</a> onto the screen, so for example, I might have 5 good reasons why <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">Managed service providers should consider using a 3rd party vendor</a> to undertake their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">documentation refresh project</a> and it will prompt me for another 5 or 10 reasons. Most will be irrelevant but I may find a gold nugget in amongst them.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Consistency</h2>
<p>Several areas that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for generating technical documentation for different audiences (technical vs non-technical)">make AI appear so human</a> yet also are big disadvantages when it comes to having an effective &amp; <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">competitive documentation framework</a> is first, how <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/creating technical documentation for big data solutions with chatgpt">terrible it handles consistency</a>.</p>
<p>It is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/creating technical documentation for complex systems with ease using chatgpt">randomly and constantly inconsistent</a>. You could say that is a type of consistency I suppose however as an example, give it an identical prompt across say 5 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/the role of chatgpt in reducing the cost of technical documentation for managed services">technical documents</a> for something as simple as using H2 Headings for each section heading.</p>
<p>It will do exactly as you ask it for 2 of those documents and then ignore your prompt for the remaining 3. You then ask it 15 different ways for headings that you know work while it apologizes for its mistake and yet <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/how to use chatgpt to create technical documentation that meets compliance and regulatory standards">fails to correct it</a>.</p>
<p>Leave it a day, put in the original prompt in the same chat and watch as it follows it to a tee.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">English Remains A Niche Expertise</h2>
<p>Just think for a moment if AI could<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation for a global audience"> write an article better than a human</a>, not just the flowery rubbish it spews out at the moment, actual <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/creating technical documentation for cloud-based solutions with chatgpt">in depth quality content</a> that is not dated and on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01">technical topics</a> from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">computer hardware</a> to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">backup as a service solutions</a>, it would mean that near enough to 8 billion people just need a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/thin clients">computer terminal</a> to be able to write great technical content at high speed, people who have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">zero technical knowledge</a>, zero English writing skills who will ultimately flood the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">internet</a> with articles no different from mine or yours.</p>
<p>There are currently around 500 million english speaking individuals on the planet, of those lets say a quarter have some type of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">technical skill</a> they could <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/creating technical documentation for troubleshooting with chatgpt">write about</a>. Take that down to a specific expertise such as what I do which is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">tech documentations strategies</a>, what maybe a million people?</p>
<p>Then take that million people and eliminate those who either are not in the situation to write or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create documentation for managed services in multiple languages">do not want to write</a> and there are probably a couple hundred thousand worldwide who either have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation that is easy to maintain and update">desire to write articles</a> on the topic.</p>
<p>So I am extremely thankful that there are not 8 billion potential <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for managed print services">content creators</a> delivering the same or better content than me on anything from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/creating technical documentation for disaster recovery with chatgpt">disaster recovery articles</a> to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/generating technical documentation for cybersecurity with chatgpt">cybersecurity</a> because if that ever happens and I am unable to differentiate my articles on say <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/creating technical documentation for virtualization with chatgpt">virtualization</a> from them then it would become a pointless exercise.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Sense Of Achievement</h2>
<p>It may take me 3 hours or so to complete a single article going off of the 60 or so <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/generating technical documentation for managed storage solutions with chatgpt">storage based articles</a> I have so far rewritten.</p>
<p>Sure my dreams of life in the fast lane with piles of cash and ladies of low morale fiber are over. I can take comfort in the sense of achievement I get everytime I complete an article.</p>
<p>I did feel slight shame and zero achievement having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/generating technical documentation for hardware using chatgpt">AI create my articles for me</a>. It just felt as hollow as anyone reading them would have felt. I may have spelling mistakes, possibly ramble more than I should and people may get to the end of my articles and dislike me because of the way I write.</p>
<p>They will not feel empty though and that is important to me.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thankfully <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/how to integrate chatgpt into your existing technical documentation process for managed services">AI is terrible at writing articles</a> especially on complex subjects such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">IT and business consulting</a> subjects where the goal is to learn something new. It seems to create what I consider the junk food of the article world. If words are calories then it stuffs articles full of calories and on completion of reading you are left feeling unsatisfied and slightly ashamed.</p>
<p>Google does not read articles, it cannot tell a good one from a bad one however what it can do is detect how fast people leave and so if you deliver <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">junk via AI</a> then people will leave almost immediately. When that happens, it is a strong indicator that your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation for project management">article is not worthwhile</a> to google and will likely not be served in the search results and after a while will be de-indexed.</p>
<p>AI is an excellent tool for certain tasks such as implementing a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">documentation framework within an MSP</a> or creating structure as well as helping with the block that comes when writing an article but it will not take the place of a human being for the foreseeable future.</p>
