<p>Documentation is an essential part of any Managed Service Provider's (MSP) daily operations. It helps MSPs to maintain a high level of organization, clarity, and consistency in their work. However, not all documentation is created equal, and poor documentation strategies can cost MSPs valuable time and resources. That's why it's crucial to understand and implement the best documentation practices, including the use of AON Network Diagrams. In this article, we will explore AON Network Diagrams in detail and explain how they can benefit MSPs. We will also introduce the two primary diagramming tools: </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/diagrams/diagram how to/how to use creately to create diagrams">Creately</span></a> and Concept Draw and describe how </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">Optimized Documentation</span></a> helps MSPs with documentation strategies, including standardizing diagrams across all clients.</span></p>

<br></br>
<h2 class="display-6">What are AON Network Diagrams?</span></h2>
<p>AON stands for Activity-on-Node, which is a graphical representation of a project's activities and their logical relationships. In other words, it is a visual tool that displays the order of events and dependencies in a project or process. AON diagrams use nodes to represent activities and arrows to represent dependencies between activities. Each node in the diagram represents an activity, and each arrow represents a relationship between activities. AON Network Diagrams are often used in project management, but they can also be applied to many other industries, including MSPs.</span></p>
<h2 class="display-6">Why AON Network Diagrams are Important for MSPs</span></h2>
<p>AON Network Diagrams are an essential tool for MSPs for several reasons. Firstly, they help MSPs to understand the dependencies and relationships between tasks, which is critical when planning and executing projects. Secondly, they help to identify bottlenecks and potential delays in a project or process. Thirdly, they provide a visual representation of the project or process, which makes it easier to communicate with clients, stakeholders, and team members. Finally, they ensure that all team members have a clear understanding of the project's objectives and expectations, which helps to avoid miscommunication and errors.</span></p>
<h2 class="display-6">Best Practices for Creating AON Network Diagrams</span></h2>
<p>To ensure that AON Network Diagrams are effective, MSPs should follow some best practices when creating them. Firstly, they should start with the end goal in mind and work backward to identify the critical path and dependencies between tasks. Secondly, they should use clear and concise language to label nodes and arrows, which makes it easier for team members to understand the diagram. Thirdly, they should keep the diagram simple and easy to read, avoiding unnecessary details and complexity. Fourthly, they should review and update the diagram regularly to reflect changes in the project or process.</span></p>

<h2 class="display-6">Diagramming Tools: Creately and Concept Draw</span></h2>
<p>There are many diagramming tools available in the market, but </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/diagrams/diagram how to/how to use creately to create diagrams">Creately</span></a> and Concept Draw are two of the most popular ones used for creating AON Network Diagrams.</span></p>
