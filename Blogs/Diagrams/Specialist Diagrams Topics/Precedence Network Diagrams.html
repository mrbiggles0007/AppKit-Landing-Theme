A lack of clear documentation can result in confusion, errors, and delays, which can lead to frustrated clients and lost revenue. Furthermore, without proper documentation, it can be difficult to identify areas for improvement or to make changes to processes and procedures. As a result, a poorly documented company can find itself stuck in inefficient practices that are difficult to change.</span></p>
