<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">Technical documentation</a> requires consistency, even items that you may think are not important such as heading size, font type, paragraph length consistency are actually very important.</p>
<p>These small items subconsciously affect the discretionary trust your staff put into the documentation that they use.</p>
<p>If that trust drops too far then they start ringing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">senior techs</a> for help and all of a sudden, 2 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff members</a> are tied up on a phone call that should never have happened &amp; that directly impacts your profitability as well as your desirability to existing and potential clients.</p>
<p>There are a number of benefits to outsourcing your MSP documentation which we will go through in this article as well as touching on how <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/overview of chatgpt and its use with technical documentation relating to managed service providers">artificial intelligence</a> is impacting how service providers carry out documentation tasks.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AI Takes The Long Way Around</h2>
<p>One thing that makes AI appear so human is that it uses a lot of words to explain how to do something that could be conveyed with far fewer words. Part of our ethos at Optimized Documentation is to use as few words as possible in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">technical document</a>.</p>
<p>This article is written completely differently to the framework we use for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">technical documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If a document is able to successfully convey a set of tasks in 10 short bullet points and a couple of screen shots and has the identical effectiveness of a 3 page document with mother beautiful, long paragraphs that Tom Clancy would have been proud of then as a technical document, the latter is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">complete failure</a>.</p>
<p>It wastes the readers time and adds pointless information which increases search time, task time and frustrates people just looking for the answer to a problem.</p>
<p>Each one of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">support desk staff</a> is at a different unique level, some want all the steps, some have completed the task a dozen times and need help with one step they have forgotten and the rest fall somewhere in between. Less is more when it comes to good quality, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">intuitive MSP documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Technical Documentation Requires Consistency</h2>
<p>Another issue with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for customer support and service">computer documentation</a> is that you need someone to go through the process in the first place and write each step.</p>
<p>This has always been a really difficult task to keep consistent. It is intuitive for the leadership of many managed service providers to get their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">top technical guys</a> that know the tasks back to front to create and manage the documentation.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Documentation Using The Weakest Link</h2>
<p>Like overcorrecting when you lose control of a car, it's intuitive &amp; yet absolutely the wrong thing to do. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">Senior technical staff</a> will write the article for themselves and as intelligent as your senior techs are, I have almost never come across a senior tech that is able to put themselves back into the shoes of someone that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">lacks technical experience</a>.</p>
<p>They overlook steps and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">entire segments</a> of a process are ignored &amp; screenshots? Forget it, who has time for that?</p>
<p>Further to this point, you will find many cannot even follow their own <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">poorly written documentation</a> when they inevitably need it in the future.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Human Nature And Free Flowing Information</h2>
<p>Senior technical staff are also normally quite comfortable in their position and human nature being what it is are sensitive to any perceived threats to their position.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">Knowledge is power</a> and often those that have this knowledge will have motivation to ensure that it is at least difficult to undertake a task if they are not available to complete it. It is an understandable view &amp; one that has at least some element of truth to it.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Adaptation To Poor Documentation</h2>
<p>I have seen plenty of examples of really bad MSP documentation in which they organize and deliver their documentation to staff.</p>
<p>All originate with the best intentions however service providers will often have very little experience with other methods to contrast against their own so they end up shoe horning methods that are not effective.</p>
<p>Human beings adapt to circumstances that when seen from the outside are almost incomprehensible. Because they are used to it, it is sometimes quite difficult to convince staff that the system they have in place while working for them, will inhibit scalability for the business itself.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Examples Of Poor Practices</h2>
<p>Having multiple meetings with both staff and leadership explaining why putting contact details for vendors into a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">specific password</a> entry or even worse, a configuration is a bad idea and that creating a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor organization</a> and putting primary contacts into that organization is always the right answer.</p>
<p>The main argument for this is that "<em>But it takes more clicks to get to the information so it's better to put it here</em>" My analogy on that is sure the pair of pliers you have in your hand can technically hammer the nail into the wood and while yes, standing up and walking to the bench to grab the hammer so the job can be done properly actually takes more steps, it is still the right action to take.</p>
<p>Attempting to explain they are the only ones that know that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">PSA contact information</a> is in that location and that it causes problems with searching is way harder than it should be.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Organizations Are Not Flexible Assets</h2>
<p>Another major mistake I am afraid to say that more service providers make than do not with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">IT Glue</a> is that they will put <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">Vendor organizations</a> into flexible assets. I have heard every reason under the sun why it is done &amp; maybe there is a valid reason out there but I have yet to hear it.</p>
<p>Make the hard decision and create an organization for every vendor you use and ensure at the absolute minimum they sync back to your PSA such as Connectwise with at least one location and one contact. Stop putting organizations into places where organizations do not belong.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Why External Documentation Makes Sense</h2>
<p>My objective here is to give reasons why engaging with an external provider for documentation remediation and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">maintenance</a> will ensure that you can keep your standards high over a long time period.</p>
<p>My recommendation if this article resonates &amp; you are nodding your head subconsciously to each of the points I make is to book an hour of time with me.</p>
<p>You will be subject to an hour of concentrated knowledge I have picked up over 10 years of experience specifically in MSP Documentation Upgrade Projects.</p>
<p>You will come away with information that will give you direction on areas you can work on that will allow you to achieve measurable improvement in a short time frame.</p>
<p>Included in the 1 hour IT Glue Documentation consultation is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Core-Asset-Framework.pdf">Vendor flexible asset template</a> &amp; full instructions which will allow your staff to instantly access vendor organizations specific to a particular client within one click within IT Glue.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">External Providers - Big Security Risk?</h2>
<p>The biggest roadblock I get put in front of me by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">technical staff</a> when it comes to MSPs using an external provider is that of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">security</a> "<em>we do not know you, do you expect us to just trust an external organization to access some of the most sensitive information we have</em>"</p>
<p>My response to that is what do MSPs do when they hire a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">new staff member</a>?</p>
<p>They take a chance on a random new technician because no matter how many references they have, service providers take a risk every time they engage a new resource and that makes no difference as to if it comes in the form of a new employee or a 3rd party organization.</p>
<p>I would go further than that and say having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">started an MSP</a> and run it for 12 years before selling it, external organizations are normally scrutinized more heavily than <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">prospective employees</a>, they are easier to cut ties with if things do not work out &amp; they have more to lose being that the service provider world at the organization level is actually pretty small.</p>
<p>Most of the industry groups have the same MSPs &amp; you do start to see the same names over again.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Inconsistencies and Inaccuracies over time</h2>
<p>As MSPs grow and change, their documentation may become outdated or fragmented, leading to inconsistencies and errors in the information being presented.</p>
<p>This is never more obvious than when key <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">MSP staff onboard</a> and then leave. I have never seen a new senior tech begin a position and not want to influence the current documentation systems in place, this often happens without fully evaluating the effectiveness of the in place framework.</p>
<p>I am sure you all have been in situations where you have lost a client where you know for an objective fact that the incoming MSP is sub standard when compared to your offerings and expertise.</p>
<p>This is the same sort of scenario. Rinse and repeat this a few times and throw in the situation where these key staff never seem to actually have time to finalize their new strategy due to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/general diagram topics/project diagram tool">project workload</a> etc and it just ends up resulting in a system that unnecessarily hinders your staff and clients and is without doubt the biggest drain on profitability.</p>
<p>This can result in confusion for both MSP employees and their clients, who may receive conflicting information from different sources.</p>
<p>Additionally, documentation may be neglected or overlooked in favor of more immediate tasks, leading to inaccuracies that can have significant impacts on the business.</p>
<p>Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure that documentation remains accurate, consistent, and up-to-date, minimizing the risk of errors and confusion.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">MSP Staff Turnover</h2>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">MSP Staff Turnover</a> where staff responsible for making changes leave and new staff make significant changes that do not align with the old system.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">key personnel</a> responsible for documentation leave the MSP, their institutional knowledge and understanding of the documentation system may leave with them.</p>
<p>This can result in a lack of continuity in the documentation process, leading to confusion and inconsistencies in the information presented.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">new staff members</a> may not fully understand the old system and may make changes that do not align with the established documentation practices.</p>
<p>Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure consistency in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">documentation practices</a> and minimize the risk of confusion and errors due to staff turnover.</p>
<p>This creates a snowball effect where frustrating systems will increase the staff turnover leading to dreadful experiences trying to find information.</p>
<p>An external organization that manages your documentation does exactly what you do, it ensures that consistency is maintained with regard to your documentation irrespective of staff turnover.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Continuity over a long time frame</h2>
<p>As MSPs evolve and grow, their documentation needs may change, and it can be challenging to maintain consistency in documentation practices over time.</p>
<p>Additionally, as technology advances and best practices shift, documentation must be updated to remain relevant and effective.</p>
<p>Managing documentation over a long time frame requires significant resources, expertise, and attention to detail, which can be challenging for MSPs to provide in-house.</p>
<p>Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure that documentation practices remain consistent and up-to-date over time.</p>
<p>This increases <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">trust in your documentation</a> from both staff and clients and allows your organization to scale easily both up or down depending on circumstances.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Constantly reinventing the wheel</h2>
<p>It is really difficult when an MSP invests a lot of energy to find a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">senior staff member</a> that is just perfect to say no to their views and recommendations.</p>
<p>It is really important to resist making any changes at least in the first 6 months.</p>
<p>They may not stay and let's face it, they probably have not given the existing system enough time to see if it may be better than what they want to replace it with.</p>
<p>Consistency is better than changing things all the time, especially if the people changing them may not be around to finish implementing the changes or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">training the staff</a> in these new changes.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Cannot Maintain Standards</h2>
<p>As MSPs grow and evolve, their documentation needs may change, leading to the creation of new documents or the restructuring of existing ones.</p>
<p>This process can be time-consuming and may result in a fragmented documentation system that is challenging to navigate and understand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can be difficult to ensure consistency in documentation structure and formatting, which can lead to confusion and errors.</p>
<p>Outsourcing documentation to a dedicated team can help ensure that documentation practices remain consistent and efficient, reducing the need for constantly reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>A dedicated team can bring expertise and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">best practices</a> to the table, ensuring that documentation structure is optimized for clarity and ease of use.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Distracting MSPs From Core Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Documentation may not be kept up to date, leading to confusion and mistakes.</p>
<p>Once a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">documentation project</a> has been completed and standards put in place, it is often quite breathtaking how fast it can all fall apart and end up back to the way it was if staff do not adhere to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">agreed to standards</a> put in place.</p>
<p>Having an external organization ensure that standards are maintained and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">staff educated</a> on how to enter information into the system does not take much time yet it ensures that your information is always kept at a high standard.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">MSPs May Lack Necessary Expertise</h2>
<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">Effective documentation</a> requires a reasonable understanding of both the technical aspects of the service or product being documented, as well as the best practices for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation that supports troubleshooting and problem-solving">documentation creation and management</a>.</p>
<p>Without this expertise, documentation may be incomplete, unclear, or difficult to use, leading to confusion and mistakes.</p>
<p>Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure that documentation is created with the necessary expertise and attention to detail.</p>
<p>A dedicated team can bring <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp-consulting">specialized knowledge</a> and experience to the table, ensuring that documentation is clear, concise, and effective in communicating the information that clients need.</p>
<p>This can help MSPs build a reputation for excellence and professionalism, while also providing their clients with the documentation they need to use and manage their services effectively.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Dedicated Resources Are Best</h2>
<p>Document management requires a range of skills and resources, including expertise in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/creating accessible technical documentation with chatgpt">content creation and management</a>, knowledge of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/limitations of chatgpt for technical writing">technical writing</a> and editing, and familiarity with industry-specific <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/how to use chatgpt to create technical documentation that meets compliance and regulatory standards">standards and regulations</a>.</p>
<p>For MSPs, these resources can be difficult to acquire and maintain, particularly as they focus on providing IT services to clients. I will often take an internally created document and find that it lacks 90% of the steps required to make it usable or the person who has created it has not checked to see if it already exists.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Avoid Reliance On Individual Employees</h2>
<p>It can be difficult to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to improve the accuracy and consistency of your technical documentation">enforce documentation standards</a> and processes without dedicated resources.</p>
<p>MSPs may have multiple teams working on different projects, each creating their own documentation.</p>
<p>This can lead to inconsistencies in style, format, and content, making it difficult for clients to find the information they need and leading to confusion and errors. Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure that consistency is maintained across all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">documentation sources</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">dedicated team</a> can establish and enforce standards for style, format, and content, ensuring that all documentation is consistent and easy to use. This can help MSPs provide a better overall experience for their clients, making it easier for them to manage and use their IT services effectively.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Documentation Is Tedious For Most Techs</h2>
<p>Creating documentation can be a tedious and uninteresting task, leading to subpar results.</p>
<p>MSPs may prioritize other tasks over documentation, resulting in incomplete or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">poorly written documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This can make it difficult for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employees</a> to understand and use the documentation, leading to confusion and errors. Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure that documentation is created and maintained by experts who are passionate about the task, resulting in better quality documentation.</p>
<p>This can help MSPs improve their overall efficiency and productivity, while providing better service to their clients.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Outsourcing Is More Cost Effective Over Time</h2>
<p>Outsourcing documentation management to a specialized team can be a more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/amazing msp facts and figures">cost-effective</a> and efficient option for managed service providers (MSPs) in the long run.</p>
<p>While it may seem like a significant investment initially, outsourcing can actually save time and money by providing access to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">dedicated resources</a> and expertise that may be lacking in-house.</p>
<p>These specialized teams are equipped with the necessary tools and technology to create and manage documentation effectively, resulting in higher quality documentation that is easily accessible and searchable.</p>
<p>Additionally, outsourcing can free up MSPs to focus on their core responsibilities and strategic objectives such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup solutions</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">server installations</a>, rather than being bogged down by the time-consuming task of managing documentation. Overall, outsourcing documentation can lead to improved efficiency, cost savings, and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">high quality documentation</a> for MSPs.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Staff Training Can Be Draining</h2>
<p>Managing documentation effectively requires a certain level of expertise and knowledge of best practices.</p>
<p>MSPs may not have the necessary resources or time to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">train their staff</a> on these practices, which can result in subpar documentation and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>By outsourcing documentation to a third-party provider who specializes in this area, MSPs can ensure that their staff have access to high-quality documentation and training, while also freeing up their own resources to focus on their core business responsibilities.</p>
<p>This can ultimately lead to more efficient and effective operations, as well as improved customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Onboarding New Staff Becomes Difficult</h2>
<p>Effective documentation is important for the smooth <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">onboarding of new employees</a> and clients.</p>
<p>Without proper documentation, it can be challenging to bring new members up to speed and ensure they have a clear understanding of company policies, procedures, and processes.</p>
<p>This can lead to misunderstandings, mistakes, and ultimately, decreased productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can also impact the satisfaction and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">retention of clients</a>, who rely on MSPs to provide reliable and consistent services.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential for managed service providers to have a robust and up-to-date documentation system to ensure a seamless onboarding process and maintain high levels of client satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">In-house Documentation Is Often Lacking</h2>
<p>When managed service providers manage their own documentation, there is a risk that the documentation may not be comprehensive or cover all the necessary topics.</p>
<p>This can lead to confusion and inefficiencies in the business. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">In-house documentation</a> may be created without taking into account all aspects of the business and may not be comprehensive enough to cover all areas of concern.</p>
<p>This can result in knowledge gaps and lack of clarity for employees and clients. Additionally, as the business evolves, new topics may arise that need to be documented, but the MSPs may not have the time or expertise to create new documentation. Outsourcing documentation to a specialized provider can ensure that all necessary topics are covered, and the documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Documentation Is Often Seen As Low Priority</h2>
<p>For managed service providers (MSPs), documentation is an important element of their operations. However, creating and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">maintaining documentation</a> can often become a lower priority when compared to other day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>As a result, documentation can be delayed or neglected, leading to incomplete or outdated information.</p>
<p>This can be problematic when new employees or clients need to be onboarded, or when existing staff require up-to-date information to perform their tasks effectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">Neglecting documentation</a> can also lead to misunderstandings or miscommunication, causing delays or errors in the provision of services. Therefore, it is important for MSPs to prioritize <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation">documentation creation</a> and management to ensure that the necessary information is available when needed.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Focus On Core Business</h2>
<p>By outsourcing documentation tasks to a specialized provider, MSPs can free up their internal resources to focus on delivering high-quality services to their clients.</p>
<p>This can result in more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">efficient operations</a>, increased <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">client satisfaction</a>, and ultimately, greater business success.</p>
<p>In addition, outsourcing documentation can provide access to specialized expertise and resources that may not be available in-house, resulting in more comprehensive and effective documentation.</p>
<p>It can also save time and resources that can be invested in other critical areas of your MSP's growth and success. Don't let poor documentation management hold your MSP back, reach out to Optimized Documentation to get started on an effective documentation strategy today.</p>
