<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are few times in history where technology has moved forward at such a rapid pace. With the advent of AI which often feels like magic, it is hard not to get a bit carried away with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy to think that AI in general is pretty much going to impact the world much the same way the USB connector or the computer itself &amp; I think in general, that is a correct view, especially considering we are right at the start of this &amp; the improvement curve is so steep already.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any new tool though, it is just a tool to make things easier. Ask yourself, what does AI need to be able to function?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It needs input from humans, without that, it fails to be useful for anything beyond interpreting history. It still needs ongoing unique content from human beings to be able to appear as if it has all the answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If humans stopped uploading unique content built on our individual experience then AI is incapable of generating new worthwhile and unique content that we can learn from.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is likely it is going to supersede Google as far as search tool though. Somewhere along the line, Google went from a very useful tool to find information you need to being just a popularity contest where the large corporations automatically receive the highest vote from Google even if the content they spew up on the first few pages is not relevant in any way to what you are looking for. ChatGPT for instance appears far more impartial to the information it delivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at any halfway popular search term and you find yourself having to wade through the first 40 results that have almost no relevance to what you are searching for to get the answers you want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just hope the new Google ChatGPT tool does not put a stranglehold on ChatGPT and start delivering non relevant information that steers us towards information engineered by the top corporations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Google has diversified so much that the search engine itself could disappear and they will continue to maintain their dominance. They probably saw the AI revolution before many of us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a tool for documentation though, it is both extremely promising in eliminating some of the more mundane areas required in a successful documentation framework deployment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is not going to implement a successful flexible asset framework though, its not going to put in a consistent password naming convention and ensure it remains relevant. If you asked it to configure and integrate your various systems, you will be very disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a long list of important tasks that AI as a tool is not capable of undertaking. As history teaches us, it will enable us to do more in less time and somewhere along the way, we will look back and find we will be working harder on more complex tasks than we ever did before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love AI and I use it for what it is good at and that for me is overcoming creative blocks and giving me ideas &amp; yes sometimes it just blows me away at how much better it is at getting points across. Is this written using AI? No, these thoughts so far are written 100% by a human being with over 25 years experience working in the MSP space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do use it for those circumstances where I need to extract my expertise onto the screen, so for example, I might have 5 good reasons why Managed service providers should consider using a 3rd party to undertake their documentation refresh project and it will prompt me for another 5 or 10 reasons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several areas that make AI appear so human yet also are big disadvantages when it comes to having an effective &amp; competitive documentation framework is first, how terrible it handles consistency. It is randomly and constantly inconsistent. You could say that is a type of consistency I suppose however as an example, give it an identical prompt across say 5 technical documents for something as simple as using H2 Headings for each section heading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will do exactly as you ask it for 2 of those documents and then ignore your prompt for the remaining 3. You then ask it 15 different ways for headings that you know work while it apologises for its mistake and yet fails to correct it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave it a day, put in the original prompt in the same chat and watch as it follows it to a tee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical documentation requires consistency, even items that you may think are not important as heading size, font type, paragraph length consistency are actually very important. These small items subconsciously affect the discretionary trust your staff put into the documentation that they use. If that trust drops too far then they start ringing senior techs for help and all of a sudden, 2 staff members are tied up on a phone call that should never have happened &amp; that directly impacts your profitability as well as your desirability to existing and potential clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have overcome these issues to an extent however part of the reason it appears so human is the fact it gives different responses to the same prompts so that issue may never completely go away.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another big issue that also makes it appear so human is that it uses a lot of words to explain how to do something that could be conveyed with far fewer words. Part of our ethos at Optimized Documentation is to use as few words as possible in a technical document.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article is written completely differently to the framework we use for technical documentation. If a document is able to successfully convey a set of tasks in 10 short bullet points and a couple of screen shots and has the identical effectiveness of a 3 page document with mother beautiful, long paragraphs that Tom Clancy would have been proud of then as a technical document, the latter is a complete failure. It wastes the readers time and adds pointless information which increases search time, task time and frustrates people just looking for the answer to a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each one of your staff is at a different unique level, some want all the steps, some have completed the task a dozen times and need help with one step they have forgotten and the rest fall somewhere in between. Less is more when it comes to good quality, intuitive MSP documentation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another issue with technical documentation is that you either need someone to go through the process in the first place and write each step. This has always been a really difficult task to keep consistent. It is intuitive for the leadership of many managed service providers to get their top guys that know the tasks back to front to create and manage the documentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like overcorrecting when you lose control of a car, its intuitive &amp; yet absolutely the wrong thing to do. They will write the article for themselves and as intelligent as your senior techs are, I have almost never come across a senior tech that is able to put themselves back into the shoes of someone that lacks technical experience. They overlook steps and entire segments of a process are ignored &amp; screenshots? Forget it, who has time for that? Further to this point, you will find many cannot even follow their own documentation when they inevitably need it in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior technical staff are also normally quite comfortable in their position and human nature being what it is are sensitive to any perceived threats to their position. Knowledge is power and often those that have this knowledge will have motivation to ensure that it is at least difficult to undertake a task if they are not available to complete it. It is an understandable view &amp; one that has at least some element of truth to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So AI cannot go through a process, even if it could, I am unsure any responsible MSP would unleash it to manage even simple things like creating accounts (At the moment). The best documentation is created by those who are conscientious, have a good attention to detail and who lack experience in the task that they are documenting. Also helps if they have a performance review coming up too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimized Documentation has seen an amazing array of ways in which MSPs organise and deliver their documentation to staff. All originate with the best intentions however MSPs will often have very little experience with other methods to contrast against their own so they end up shoe horning methods that are not effective. Human beings adapt to circumstances that when seen from the outside are almost incomprehensible. Because they are used to it, it is sometimes quite difficult to convince staff that the system they have in place while working for them, will inhibit scalability for the business itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples? Having multiple meetings with both staff and leadership explaining why putting contact details for Vendors into a specific password entry or even worse, a configuration is a bad idea and that creating a vendor organization and putting primary contacts into that organization is always the right answer. The main argument for this is that "But it takes more clicks to get to the information so its better to put it here" Attempting to explain they are the only ones that know that the contact information is in that location and that it causes problems with searching is way harder than it should be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major mistake I am afraid to say that more MSPs make than do not with IT Glue is that they will put Vendors into flexible assets. I have heard every reason under the sun why it is done &amp; maybe there is a valid reason out there but I have yet to hear it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the hard decision and create an organization for every vendor you use and ensure at the absolute minimum they sync back to your PSA with at least one location and one contact. Stop putting organizations into places where organizations do not belong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has been one hell of an introduction. My objective here is to give reasons why engaging with an external provider for documentation remediation and maintenance will ensure that you can keep your standards high over a long time period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My recommendation if this article resonates &amp; you are nodding your head subconsciously to each of the points I make is to book an hour of time with me. You will be subject to an hour of concentrated knowledge I have picked up over 10 years of experience specifically in MSP Documentation Upgrade Projects. You will come away with information that will give you direction on areas you can work on that will allow you to achieve measurable improvement in a short time frame.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included in the 1 hour IT Glue Documentation consultation is a Vendor flexible asset template &amp; full instructions which will allow your staff to instantly access vendor organizations specific to a particular client within one click within IT Glue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest roadblock I get put in front of me by technical staff when it comes to MSPs using an external provider is that it "we do not know you, do you expect us to just trust an external organization to access some of the most sensitive information we have"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My response to that is what do MSPs do when they hire a new staff member? They take a chance on a random because no matter how many references they have, MSPs take a risk every time they engage a new resource and that makes no difference as to if it comes in the form of a new employee or a 3rd party organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would go further than that and say having owned my own MSP for 12 years before selling it, external organizations are normally scrutinized more heavily than prospective employees, they are easier to cut ties with if things do not work out &amp; they have more to lose being that the MSP world at the organization level is actually pretty small. Most of the industry groups have the same MSPs &amp; you do start to see the same names over again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are the reasons that I recommend managed service providers engage with external providers over attempting to manage&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inconsistencies and Inaccuracies over time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;As MSPs grow and change, their documentation may become outdated or fragmented, leading to inconsistencies and errors in the information being presented. This is never more obvious than when key employees join and then leave. I have never seen a new senior tech begin a position and not want to influence the current documentation systems in place, this often happens without fully evaluating the effectiveness of the in place framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am sure you all have been in situations where you have lost a client where you know for an objective fact that the incoming MSP is sub standard when compared to your offerings and expertise. This is the same sort of scenario. Rinse and repeat this a few times and throw in the situation where these key staff never seem to actually have time to finalize their new strategy due to project workload etc and it just ends up resulting in a system that unnecessarily hinders your staff and clients and is without doubt the biggest drain on profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can result in confusion for both MSP employees and their clients, who may receive conflicting information from different sources. Additionally, documentation may be neglected or overlooked in favor of more immediate tasks, leading to inaccuracies that can have significant impacts on the business. Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure that documentation remains accurate, consistent, and up-to-date, minimizing the risk of errors and confusion.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSP Staff Turnover</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;staff responsible for making changes leave and new staff make significant changes that do not align with the old system. When key personnel responsible for documentation leave the MSP, their institutional knowledge and understanding of the documentation system may leave with them. This can result in a lack of continuity in the documentation process, leading to confusion and inconsistencies in the information presented. Additionally, new staff members may not fully understand the old system and may make changes that do not align with the established documentation practices. Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure consistency in documentation practices and minimize the risk of confusion and errors due to staff turnover.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is creates a snowball effect where frustrating systems will increase the staff turnover leading to dreadful experiences trying to find information. An external organization that manages your documentation does exactly what you do, it ensures that consistency is maintained with regard to your documentation irrespective of staff turnover.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuity over a long time frame</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;As MSPs evolve and grow, their documentation needs may change, and it can be challenging to maintain consistency in documentation practices over time. Additionally, as technology advances and best practices shift, documentation must be updated to remain relevant and effective. Managing documentation over a long time frame requires significant resources, expertise, and attention to detail, which can be challenging for MSPs to provide in-house. Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure that documentation practices remain consistent and up-to-date over time. This increases trust in your documentation from both staff and clients and allows your organization to scale easily both up or down depending on circumstances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constantly reinventing the wheel with documentation structure</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is really difficult when an MSP invests a lot of energy to find a senior staff member that is just perfect to say no to their views and recommendations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is really important to resist making any changes at least in the first 6 months. They may not stay and lets face it, they probably have not given the existing system enough time to see if it may be better than what they want to replace it with.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistency is better than changing things all the time especially if the people changing them may not be around to finish implementing the changes or training the staff in these new changes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of being able to maintain standards over the life of a business</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As MSPs grow and evolve, their documentation needs may change, leading to the creation of new documents or the restructuring of existing ones. This process can be time-consuming and may result in a fragmented documentation system that is challenging to navigate and understand. Furthermore, it can be difficult to ensure consistency in documentation structure and formatting, which can lead to confusion and errors. Outsourcing documentation&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to a dedicated team can help ensure that documentation practices remain consistent and efficient, reducing the need for constantly reinventing the wheel. A dedicated team can bring expertise and best practices to the table, ensuring that documentation structure is optimized for clarity and ease of use.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time-consuming and distracting MSPs from their core responsibilities.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentation may not be kept up to date, leading to confusion and mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a documentation project has been completed and standards put in place, it is often quite breathtaking how fast it can all fall apart and end up back to the way it was if staff do not adhere to the agreed to standards put in place.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an external organization ensure that standards are maintained and staff educated on how to enter information into the system does not take much time yet it ensures that your information is always kept at a high standard.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSPs may lack the necessary expertise to create effective documentation.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective documentation requires a deep understanding of both the technical aspects of the service or product being documented, as well as the best practices for documentation creation and management. Without this expertise, documentation may be incomplete, unclear, or difficult to use, leading to confusion and mistakes. Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure that documentation is created with the necessary expertise and attention to detail. A dedicated team can bring specialized knowledge and experience to the table, ensuring that documentation is clear, concise, and effective in communicating the information that clients need. This can help MSPs build a reputation for excellence and professionalism, while also providing their clients with the documentation they need to use and manage their services effectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document management can be a complex and specialized task requiring dedicated resources.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document management requires a range of skills and resources, including expertise in content creation and management, knowledge of technical writing and editing, and familiarity with industry-specific standards and regulations. For MSPs, these resources can be difficult to acquire and maintain, particularly as they focus on providing IT services to clients. I will often take an internally created document and find that it lacks 90% of the steps required to make it usable or the person who has created it has not checked to see if it already exists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of documentation can lead to knowledge gaps and reliance on individual employees.</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be difficult to enforce documentation standards and processes without dedicated resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSPs may have multiple teams working on different projects, each creating their own documentation. This can lead to inconsistencies in style, format, and content, making it difficult for clients to find the information they need and leading to confusion and errors. Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure that consistency is maintained across all documentation sources. A dedicated team can establish and enforce standards for style, format, and content, ensuring that all documentation is consistent and easy to use. This can help MSPs provide a better overall experience for their clients, making it easier for them to manage and use their IT services effectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating documentation can be a tedious and uninteresting task, leading to subpar results.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating documentation can be a tedious and uninteresting task, leading to subpar results. MSPs may prioritize other tasks over documentation, resulting in incomplete or poorly written documentation. This can make it difficult for employees to understand and use the documentation, leading to confusion and errors. Outsourcing documentation management to a dedicated team can help ensure that documentation is created and maintained by experts who are passionate about the task, resulting in better quality documentation. This can help MSPs improve their overall efficiency and productivity, while providing better service to their clients.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing documentation can be more cost-effective and efficient in the long run.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing documentation management to a specialized team can be a more cost-effective and efficient option for managed service providers (MSPs) in the long run. While it may seem like a significant investment initially, outsourcing can actually save time and money by providing access to dedicated resources and expertise that may be lacking in-house. These specialized teams are equipped with the necessary tools and technology to create and manage documentation effectively, resulting in higher quality documentation that is easily accessible and searchable. Additionally, outsourcing can free up MSPs to focus on their core responsibilities and strategic objectives, rather than being bogged down by the time-consuming task of managing documentation. Overall, outsourcing documentation can lead to improved efficiency, cost savings, and higher quality documentation for MSPs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSPs may not have the time or expertise to train staff on documentation best practices.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing documentation effectively requires a certain level of expertise and knowledge of best practices. MSPs may not have the necessary resources or time to train their staff on these practices, which can result in subpar documentation and inefficiencies. By outsourcing documentation to a third-party provider who specializes in this area, MSPs can ensure that their staff have access to high-quality documentation and training, while also freeing up their own resources to focus on their core business responsibilities. This can ultimately lead to more efficient and effective operations, as well as improved customer satisfaction.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of documentation can lead to difficulties in onboarding new employees and clients.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective documentation is crucial for the smooth onboarding of new employees and clients. Without proper documentation, it can be challenging to bring new members up to speed and ensure they have a clear understanding of company policies, procedures, and processes. This can lead to misunderstandings, mistakes, and ultimately, decreased productivity and efficiency. Furthermore, it can also impact the satisfaction and retention of clients, who rely on MSPs to provide reliable and consistent services. Therefore, it is essential for managed service providers to have a robust and up-to-date documentation system to ensure a seamless onboarding process and maintain high levels of client satisfaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-house documentation may not be comprehensive or cover all necessary topics.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When managed service providers manage their own documentation, there is a risk that the documentation may not be comprehensive or cover all the necessary topics. This can lead to confusion and inefficiencies in the business. In-house documentation may be created without taking into account all aspects of the business and may not be comprehensive enough to cover all areas of concern. This can result in knowledge gaps and lack of clarity for employees and clients. Additionally, as the business evolves, new topics may arise that need to be documented, but the MSPs may not have the time or expertise to create new documentation. Outsourcing documentation to a specialized provider can ensure that all necessary topics are covered, and the documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating documentation can be a lower priority for MSPs, leading to delays or neglect.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For managed service providers (MSPs), documentation is a crucial element of their operations. However, creating and maintaining documentation can often become a lower priority when compared to other day-to-day tasks. As a result, documentation can be delayed or neglected, leading to incomplete or outdated information. This can be problematic when new employees or clients need to be onboarded, or when existing staff require up-to-date information to perform their tasks effectively. Neglecting documentation can also lead to misunderstandings or miscommunication, causing delays or errors in the provision of services. Therefore, it is important for MSPs to prioritize documentation creation and management to ensure that the necessary information is available when needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing documentation can allow MSPs to focus on their core competencies and provide better service to clients.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By outsourcing documentation tasks to a specialized provider, MSPs can free up their internal resources to focus on delivering high-quality services to their clients. This can result in more efficient operations, increased client satisfaction, and ultimately, greater business success. In addition, outsourcing documentation can provide access to specialized expertise and resources that may not be available in-house, resulting in more comprehensive and effective documentation.</span></p>
