<div data-linkz-ai-container>
<p>Documentation platforms such as the Hudu <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation">documentation platform</a> have really only existed for the past decade. Prior to 2014, if you asked most service providers what a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation management solution</a> actually was, you would likely have found <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Sharepoint</a> as the most common answer.</p>
<p>I clearly remember having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">started my own MSP</a> in around 2004, grappling with the lack of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">effective documentation solutions</a>. Before I even <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">purchased connectwise</a>, I spent countless hours attempting to configure <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/crm/">MS CRM</a> that came included with the action pack so that I could give my techs useful information on the go.</p>
<p>Even back then <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/crm/">Microsoft CRM</a> had a mobile client and you could create primitive <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">versions of flexible assets</a> that we see today in the likes of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">ITGlue</a>. Of course I was never all that successful as it was clunky and required significant amounts of effort <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">out of the box</a> which meant that when I got busy, it took a back seat to the work that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">paid the bills</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward around 10 years and I became aware of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">IT Glue</a>. I remember using it for the first time and coming to the realization that it was everything I had tried creating a decade prior plus so much more. It revolutionized the way many <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">MSPs do business</a>. Of course it is like any piece of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">widely available software</a>, a rising tide lifts all boats and so some would argue it ultimately changes nothing.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">MSP Documentation Landscape</h2>
<p>Put simply, if you do not have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">documentation platform</a> of some type, you are either just starting out or will not survive. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">Your organization</a> just cannot compete in today&rsquo;s market without some type of off the shelf <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">documentation system</a>.</p>
<p>You need a fast efficient way to be able to put the information your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">support desk</a> needs in front of them. If your competitor does that twice as fast as you can then ultimately you are doing yourself and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">your clients</a> a disservice.</p>
<p>You can get Hudu licenses on a self hosted platform for about $30 a month at the lowest level and that includes 3 users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is just no thought process required here. Anyone that attempts to debate the topic and suggest they have an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">internal system</a> based off of Sharepoint or Onenote telegraphs to me that they do not comprehend the benefits and are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">lacking in experience</a> and knowledge.</p>
<p>Efficiency and a good documentation system specifically designed for MSPs makes such an enormous difference to an operation, it is hard to comprehend.</p>
<p>Most MSPs have a decision to make, are you the mechanic or the tool maker? Messing about and attempting to shoe horn Sharepoint or another non MSP focused tool into a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation">documentation platform</a> is a waste of resources when you will only ever reach about 10% functionality and end up with something that is unable to integrate with an almost unlimited number of tools.</p>
<p>It means giving up having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">information in one place</a>, needing more qualified people who have more experience with how to get information they need from 7 different platforms and making it difficult to scale up, down or sell the business when the time comes.</p>
<p>Our team specializes in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation strategies</a> for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">US based service providers</a> and we assist in improving profit margins through standardization and consistent record keeping strategies, so you can be confident that our content is tailored to your needs.</p>
