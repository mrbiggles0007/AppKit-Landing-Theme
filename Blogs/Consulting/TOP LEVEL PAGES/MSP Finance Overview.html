<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed Services Provider (MSP) Finance is a crucial aspect of managing a business that outsources its IT functions to an MSP. MSP Finance involves managing the financial aspects of an MSP's service delivery, including budgeting, financial analysis and reporting, cash management, and risk management. With the rise of MSPs as a popular option for businesses looking to reduce costs and improve efficiency, MSP Finance has become increasingly important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of MSPs, as businesses looked for ways to quickly transition to remote work and reduce costs. According to a recent report by EY, the pandemic has increased demand for MSPs, with 66% of companies planning to increase their use of MSPs in the post-COVID-19 era. This has created a greater need for MSP Finance expertise, as businesses look to manage their finances effectively while working with MSPs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In North America, the United States has been at the forefront of MSP adoption, with a market size of over $228 billion in 2020.

Effective management of MSP finances can help businesses achieve cost savings, improve service delivery, and mitigate risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key aspect of MSP Finance is documentation. Managed Services Provider Documentation is crucial for ensuring that all aspects of an MSP's service delivery are clearly defined and documented, including financial aspects. This documentation is essential for managing costs, ensuring compliance, and improving service delivery.</span></p>
