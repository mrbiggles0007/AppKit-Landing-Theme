<p>Which MSP application to use for client documentation will be the discussion of today's important topic.</p>
<p>Back when I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">started my first MSP</a> in around 2004, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp documentation apps overview">MSP documentation applications</a> did not exist. It legitimately was a nightmare and I talk about trying to cobble together my own MSP documentation application using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">Microsoft CRM</a> back in those days.</p>
<p>Today is different and while there is a significant number of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">MSP documentation tools</a> on offer today, I am only going to be discussing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">knowledge base tools</a> I have direct exposure to and even then, I am only going to mention in passing the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">applications</a> that I considered <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">lacking in features</a> or structure.</p>
<p>Ultimately and practically it leaves two <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">MSP documentation platforms</a> to consider and that is either <a href="https://www.itglue.com/">IT Glue</a> or its direct competitor, <a href="https://hudu.com/">Hudu</a>. They both have advantages and disadvantages which I will go into below.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">MSP Client Documentation NON Contenders</h2>
<p>I have experienced many <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp documentation apps-index-page">MSP documentation management apps</a> over the years and for the most part, they can be discounted from consideration either due to being designed more for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">internal IT departments</a> than MSPs such as <a href="https://www.n-able.com/products/passportal">Passportal</a> to being an ill advised add on from a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">MSP vendor</a> that specializes in something else such as an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">RMM tool</a> and has thought it was a good idea to divert effort from their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting statistics on msp hardware purchasing">main product</a> and create something woeful that when measured against the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">market leaders</a> is substandard in almost every area such as <a href="https://www.connectwise.com/en-au/platform/business-management/itboost">ITBoost</a> by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">Connectwise</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a list in no particular order of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/application purchase and cloud-based subscription fees">current offerings</a> that I have tried and found lacking because they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">lack the basic features</a> such as client documentation management, appropriate <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/microsoft-teams-integration">levels of integration</a> and in one case, no <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">search functionality</a>! I have also not included tools that are sometimes shoehorned into documentation such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SharePoint">Sharepoint</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_OneNote">OneNote</a>.</p>
</div>

</ul>
<div data-linkz-ai-container>
<p>The primary reason why the MSP client documentation apps above are discounted is that in most cases, the client documentation component is substandard and in the rest of the cases, non-existent.</p>
<p>Passportal for example, I had heard many great things about it and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">obtained a client</a> that used it as their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">primary documentation platform</a> and I have to say, it was woeful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So much so that I do not believe it was really designed for an MSP. It seemed as though it was made for an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">internal IT department</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no client documentation component and no easy way to segregate and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">publicly share</a> client specific articles not to mention you had to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">reinvent the wheel</a> for each client. What I mean by that is I had to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">recreate the documentation framework</a> for each client instead of being able to recreate the documentation framework from a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">single original template</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">MSP Client Documentation App Requirements</h2>
<p>Just so we are all on the same page here, when I speak of the client documentation side of an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp documentation apps overview">MSP documentation application</a>, I am talking about the functionality <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">built into the app</a> so that it makes it easy to create and maintain a repository specifically for a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">single client</a>.</p>
<p>Below I will go into the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">specific features</a> that I consider <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">requirements</a> when it comes to proper client documentation capability.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Easy To Use Out Of The Box</h4>
<p>There are only two options for MSP client documentation that are currently worth considering and that is Hudu or ITGlue out of the box and even now I hate to admit it, ITGlue with its MYGlue unlimited number of free <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">read only accounts</a> wipes the floor with the underdeveloped <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">customer portal</a> of Hudu.</p>
<p>The MYGlue integration with ITGlue is very intuitive even if you have never used it before and the ability to setup myglue users and myglue groups is pretty painless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot really make the mistake of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">accidentally giving access</a> to the wrong organization when creating a myglue user because they are only able to be added to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">single organization</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">How Organizations And Locations Are Handled</h4>
<p>This is another area where ITGlue just handles things so much better. For example when ITGlue is set up, it <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">syncs the organization</a> along with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">locations of that organization</a> with your selected <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">PSA tool</a>.</p>
<p>I have always found creating a location in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">PSA tool</a> is preferred rather than trying to create it in ITGlue because for some reason, creating it in ITGlue often <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">causes sync issues</a> where either two identical locations are created or it disappears. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">Creating it in the PSA</a> is bulletproof.</p>
<p>Locations in Hudu need to be filed under &ldquo;<em>I thought that locations would be a basic feature</em>&rdquo; You have to either <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">create child sites</a> under the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">parent organization</a> or create an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">asset class</a> and call the asset class &ldquo;<em>Locations</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Honestly after <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">hearing all the praise</a> about Hudu, I was left a little shocked that the client&rsquo;s sites are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">treated in a half hearted way</a>, actually that is a polite way of saying they are completely ignored.</p>
<p>The big gotcha here is that with Hudu, to access the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation">client documentation</a>, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">created user</a> is only able to access a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">single site</a> from the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">user portal</a> meaning if you have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">big organization</a> with 30 sites, good luck creating a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">client side portal</a> user because they can only access one of those 30 sites. It is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">logistical nightmare</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">do not want to complain</a> but one of the reasons many move from ITGlue is due to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">Kaseya&rsquo;s woeful business practices</a> and lack of acceptable <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-client-index">development in the product</a> so it disappoints me to see that Hudu have had this listed for <strong>3 years</strong> within the top 30 requests and it has not even been looked at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if my experience with ITGlue is anything to go by, this means it is an issue you will just <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">have to live with</a> as it will not be worked on anytime soon.</p>
<p>The beauty of MYGlue is that it is basically the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">same database</a> that ITGlue runs from so there is no need to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">replicate information</a>. It <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">handles permissions</a> slightly differently and the client has the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">ability to create passwords</a> that you can half see which leads to confusion.</p>
<p>So the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">passwords created</a> by the client that have not been assigned ITGlue permissions will be missing from the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">clients password folder</a> list under their organization however will show up in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">global password</a> tab under the client.</p>
<p>I found this frustrating because they most often do not follow our <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">naming convention</a> and have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">not been filled out</a> correctly. I am all good with that, if the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">client has passwords</a> that we do not manage and want to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">keep them confidential</a> as long as it does not mess up my mother beautiful <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">global lists</a> which of course they do.</p>
<p>I have circumvented this by having our own MYGlue user where we can <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">log in</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">modify the permissions</a> so that we can modify to suit (obtaining client permission of course) as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">ongoing client training</a> on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">naming conventions</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">PSA Sync To MSP Client Documentation</h4>
<p>The fact Hudu still is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">unable to sync locations</a> untouched from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise PSA</a>&nbsp; or many other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">class leading PSAs</a> into Hudu and the sites need to be created separately is a real dealbreaker.</p>
<p>Because of the way I set up the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">MSP documentation app</a>, the PSA is the truth teller, it is the first and final place where<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not"> company and location information</a> is guaranteed to be accurate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find the idea of introducing such a large chance for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">human error</a> not to mention the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">excessive man hours</a> required to maintain two completely separate versions of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">clients organizational structure</a> in the form of the sites that make up the client to be unacceptable.</p>
<p>I set up ITGlue so that only two types of organizations exist, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">clients</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendors</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These entities are set up in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">Connectwise Manage</a> and I ensure that these organizations are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">filled out completely</a> and the naming standard is on point both for the client name as well as site names.</p>
<p>This ensures that when doing a global search in ITGlue, I can bring up every single client head office by typing in <strong>01</strong> because my naming convention for a head office is <strong><em>01 Head Office (State Abbreviation)</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use <strong>02</strong> for branch offices, <strong>03</strong> for home offices and <strong>04</strong> for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">virtual offices</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">data centers</a>. This <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">exact structure</a> then syncs to ITGlue without any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">further effort</a> and zero chance of human error.</p>
<p>This structure is also available in MYGlue as part of the client side documentation interface without having to do any further work and again zero chance for human error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bonus is that you can <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security resources overview">lock down assets</a> via <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">group permissions</a> in ITGlue and so can choose if you want to make locations available to view to the client.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the free read only portal user can only access one client site per user in the Hudu customer portal which is just outrageous and something I hope gets changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly, looking at the <a href="https://hudu.canny.io/feature-requests?sort=top">Hudu feature request list</a> that all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">MSP vendors</a> seem to have, it is actually giving me ITGlue development flashbacks. Of the top 35 most requested features, none of them are in progress and most are many years old.</p>
<p>I get pretty annoyed when I see a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">vendor</a> put something up like a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">feature request board</a> and request that we as clients come up with the most popular and required functionality only for that information to be completely ignored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently the <a href="https://hudu.canny.io/feature-requests?status=in-progress">features in progress</a> are almost all features that are at the very bottom of the feature request popularity scale as determined by existing clients, it is infuriating!</p>
<p>My question has always been to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">vendors</a>, why put up a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">feature request board</a> that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">tracks popularity of requests</a> if you are going to just completely ignore the information it provides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We the clients gave you the information you have requested and you should now use that information to prioritize the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">development path</a>. It is not a hard game&hellip; anyway where were we?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Company Type - Control On Sync</h4>
<p>File this under &ldquo;<em>I cannot believe the ability to filter company types does not exist</em>&rdquo; because on ITGlue under the sync settings with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">Connectwise PSA</a>, with a tick in a box, decide what types of companies I allow across with ITGlue.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">CW Manage</a> as an example here, most of us have been in the game for 20+ years and if you were like me at the start, I legitimately had no clue how to set up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">CW Manage</a> effectively. This means that there is an evolution that has occurred over a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">long period of time</a>.</p>
<p>You probably have 23 different types of companies of which 21 should never make it across to the MSP documentation platform. Either they are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client</a> or a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor</a>, no other company type should exist in your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">documentation platform</a>.</p>
<p>You cannot do that in Hudu, so brace yourself as 3000 companies of which 2547 are no longer relevant for reasons such as never having become a client or you setup an organization types incorrectly of Rotary Client, business breakfast client, large client, small client, anyway you get the picture, you have pointless client types.</p>
<p>The first job is to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">change the client type</a> to either <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor</a> in ITGlue and then tick two boxes that allow those two organizations to sync while leaving the junk back in your PSA. Unfortunately with Hudu there is no way to do this.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Client Documentation User Permissions</h4>
<p>Once again, <strong>ITGlue decimates Hudu in this department</strong> although it seems Hudu has put the feature of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">folder level permissions</a> under review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something to be aware of here is that the &ldquo;<em>under review</em>&rdquo; status has been set on all feature requests in that status within about the last 3 months from the date this article was written.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The review process trigger should be a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">considered decision</a> and there should be a random number of feature requests put into that status over a medium to long term time scale.</p>
<p>It would be the equivalent of an MSP finding 50 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">tickets</a> that had been forgotten about and then <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top 36 applications and solutions for automotive">mass updating</a> them to in progress in that the status change signifies almost nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">folder level permissions</a> will be at least another 3 years away for Hudu which coincidentally is about the same length of time it will take me to update all of my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">KB articles</a> one by one.</p>
<p>Without this feature it means that you have to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">apply permissions</a> to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">individual knowledge base</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">SOP articles</a> and trust me, it is an absolute nightmare to manage across a large number of clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ITGlue in tandem with MYGlue handles access really well via ITGlue group permissions that flow down in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">hierarchical fashion</a>.</p>
<p>This means with both ITGlue and MYGlue (Customer facing documentation system) I can create a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">folder structure</a> in the documents area and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">apply permissions to a folder</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every document placed in that folder will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">inherit the permissions</a> of that folder meaning you do not have to be forever <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">applying permissions</a> to specific articles.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Client Documentation User Groups</h4>
<p>I promise I do not receive kickbacks from ITGlue, in fact the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">business practices of Kaseya</a> has me desperately wanting Hudu to come out on top as far as client documentation for MSPs is concerned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is just one area that Hudu has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">deemed a low priority</a> and that is the self service client documentation side of things. My view it is up there with among the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">most important features</a> a competent MSP client documentation package can offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IT Glue user groups are simple, intuitive and surprisingly effective given their simplicity. I can add the same user to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security incidents msp - index">multiple groups</a> of which the most restrictive selection is the dominant selection.</p>
<p>This means if I have a user in two groups and one is denied access to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">organizations passwords</a> and one is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">allowed passwords</a> then the user is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">denied access to passwords</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I am not saying it is as streamlined as permissions or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">security in active directory</a> but it is good enough for most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">use cases</a> and ultimately it is too bad if it isn&rsquo;t because unfortunately there is no other product that is better than IT Glue and MYGlue in this area.</p>
<p>Hudu on the other hand handles <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">user permissions</a> in the oddest way. You can only add one user to a single group meaning it really requires significant pre planning and as mentioned above this is compounded by the fact you cannot <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">apply permissions</a> to a Hudu folder only to the article.</p>
<p>Imagine having 2000 knowledgebase articles which is not unreasonable in a medium sized company and having to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">apply the permissions</a> to those articles individually?</p>
<p>As a heavy ITG user, it is very easy to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">restrict sensitive financial</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">human resources</a> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">knowledgebase articles</a> by applying specific group access to the financial or human resources folder under the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">root KB</a> folder however the only way to really be able to do this in Hudu is to create a fake organization such as &ldquo;<em>MyCompany - Finance</em>&rdquo; and or &ldquo;<em>MyCompany - HR</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This allows for a somewhat effective way to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">restrict permissions</a> however it goes against every principle I have learnt about in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">management of IT documentation</a>. It means breaking up and segmenting your company information into multiple fake organizations within Hudu.</p>
<p>Imagine being asked by the client to do this for them as well. Suddenly you are going to have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">duplicate organizations</a> popping up like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">some sort of infection</a>. It is just quite impractical for clients because of this which means there is a serious <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps are moving to halo psa">lack of granularity</a> when it comes to permissions when using Hudu on the client documentation side.</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>ITGlue wipes the floor</strong> as far as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">group and folder permissions</a> are concerned on both the MSP side as well as the MSP Client documentation side of things.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Feature Request System For Client Documentation</h4>
<p>This is not directly related to the actual client documentation management however having an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">MSP vendor</a> take the feature requests of their clients seriously makes a massive difference to the confidence in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp documentation apps overview">documentation app</a> being used as well as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp ai adoption that artificial intelligence delivered">long term outlook</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of us are pretty reasonable and understand any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">piece of software</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">cloud based application</a> will not be perfect all at once. As service providers the last thing we want is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">dishonest claims</a> about <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps are moving to halo psa">ongoing improvement</a>.</p>
<p>This is the very reason there has been an exodus from IT Glue. To be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/backup vendor experiences.">fair to Kaseya</a>, IT Glue were woeful in product development right from the very start even <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/backup vendor experiences.">before Kaseya</a> was ever involved.</p>
<p>They even used it to determine what <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">paid add ons</a> they could <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">profit from</a> rather than using it to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps are moving to halo psa">add features</a> to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">existing product</a>. Then <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/backup vendor experiences.">Kaseya took over</a> and turbo charged the poor treatment of their clients through <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">deceptive business practices</a> especially with regards to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">unauthorized billing</a>, overcharging and automatic multi year contract renewals without providing reasonable warning.</p>
<p>Now having looked at the <a href="https://hudu.canny.io/feature-requests?sort=top">feature request system</a> of Hudu, I am left having flashbacks and cold sweats as they appear to be heading down the same direction as ITG did. Their <a href="https://hudu.canny.io/feature-requests?sort=top">top 30+ most popular feature requests</a> are on average 3 years old and not a single one of them is being worked on.</p>
<p>Looking a little deeper and I cross reference the <a href="https://hudu.canny.io/feature-requests?status=in-progress">in progress feature requests</a> to find most of them are the least popular requests with most having less than 20 votes. Compare this to the most popular which have 550+ votes and that irritating behavior of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">ignoring clients</a> is quite obvious.</p>
<p>So in summary, <strong>nobody here comes out looking good</strong> as far as product development is concerned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hudu did seem to be doing well there for a while and their reputation online always seems to be quite positive however just by looking at the actual facts of the matter, my view is that currently that reputation is probably overblown by MSP owners who are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising facts about managed backups with managed service providers">positively reinforcing</a> the move they made away from ITG rather than giving an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">honest comparison</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>At the time of writing this article, it pains me to say this however when it comes to managing your MSPs client documentation, <strong>IT Glue is still the leading documentation platform</strong>. Yes it <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">costs more</a>, yes you will be locked into a multi year contract and will probably feel abused by the way <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/backup vendor experiences.">Kaseya treats you</a> as a client.</p>
<p>None of that matters when compared to the deficiencies that Hudu still exhibits. They have had a good 3 years now to get to the point of being a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">superior product</a> and I am so disappointed after my testing that it is still so far behind in what I would consider basic features.</p>
<p>Other irritations with Hudu that have been standard for half a decade with ITG that while not being deal breakers are still frustrating such as <a href="https://hudu.canny.io/feature-requests/p/2-way-sync">lack of 2-way sync</a> with your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">PSA or RMM</a>, a very <a href="https://hudu.canny.io/feature-requests/p/integration-with-azure-ad-or-intune">limited integration</a> selection, <a href="https://hudu.canny.io/feature-requests/p/domain-name-tracking">lack of DNS tracking</a>, <a href="https://hudu.canny.io/feature-requests/p/wildcard-search">wild card searching</a> or having the ability to copy/paste html directly into the document edit area, you must use the WYSIWYG.</p>
<p>Even 1-way sync with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise PSA</a> does not work properly because while yes it syncs some limited information across at the time of the sync, it is unable to detect changes on the CW PSA side meaning if you edit something in CW Manage, you will end up with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps are moving to halo psa">incorrect information</a> in Hudu until a full one way sync re occurs.</p>
<p>My view is <strong>IT Glue will remain the class leading client documentation platform in the form of MYGlue for at least the next few years</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I say this because these are not small items to rectify and I suspect if Hudu worked on these one after the other starting today, it would still take at least 3 years to complete.</p>
<p>I think I can summarize it best by using an analogy here. ITGlue under Kaseya is the abusive girlfriend that treats you poorly yet nothing else compares while Hudu is the drama free long term girlfriend that started out with so much promise and yet no longer excites you. She is understanding although keeps failing on promises made yet does not really do anything wrong except you are now seeing some of the same behaviors you disliked in the abusive girlfriend with none of the benefits.</p>
