<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">Standard operating procedures</a> and the tips I have collected over the years to help you create an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">effective documentation strategy</a> will be the topic of today&rsquo;s article.</p>
<p>I will touch on what a standard operating procedure is and how to easily identify if it is a SOP versus a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">knowledgebase</a> article. You can use any documentation platform to apply the tips I use here however I will be using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">ITGlue</a> as the example in this article.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">What Is A Standard Operating Procedure?</h2>
<p>SOPs are like an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for it infrastructure">instruction guide</a> for your own business. So things like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">dress code</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">lunch breaks</a> to the process involved in applying for leave.</p>
<p>Some would say that if you do not have a standard operating procedure then you do not really have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">business to sell</a>. The reason for this is that without a SOP, you are forcing people to assume how to operate on a day to day basis and more than likely that requires a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">key person</a> (you) to be at least a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">phone call away</a> if and when <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">employees need guidance</a> on how to approach a near infinite number of scenarios.</p>
<p>Standard Operating Procedures are actually quite difficult to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/diagram-standardization">templatize</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">duplicate</a> because each organization is going to be at least slightly different. The best SOPs are those that are written from the ground up as your organization grows.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Is A SOP Part Of A Knowledgebase</h2>
<p>Standard operating procedures can be part of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">knowledge base</a> however it could be argued that is an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">incorrect framework</a> and that both should be kept separate. I have known a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">medium sized MSP</a> that had the top level that was called the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">knowledgebase</a> and the SOP was a subfolder under this. They were able to make it work however after 20 odd years of exposure to different strategies, I would avoid this type of setup. First, it is not standard meaning when you hire employees, you will have to train for this exception and that is just a wasted step in my book.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">A knowledgebase</a> as far as I and most other MSPs will define it is a repository for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for managed print services">internal technical guides</a> that is collected over time.</p>
<p>The way I set up the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">knowledge base internally</a> is to have a single <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">internal knowledgebase</a> that holds two <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">top level folders</a> called internal and external. The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">internal folder</a> holds a duplicate folder structure of the external plus any extra folders that may be relevant to the internal structure of the business such as a &ldquo;<em>datacenter</em>&rdquo; folder.</p>
<p>The external folder retains all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/MSP IT Consulting Services">client based technical instructions</a> that could universally relate to all clients. So this means <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">generic guides</a> relating to setting up say an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/mobile phones for business">Apple Iphone</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/business notebooks &amp; laptops">company notebook</a>. I use the publish publicly in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">documentation platform</a> to create a public link that all clients can access for these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">generic guides</a>.</p>
<p>Each client also has its <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">own knowledgebase</a> with an identical folder structure. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/MSP IT Consulting Services">Client specific technical guides</a> are located in these and they are located under each client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there should be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">multiple knowledge bases</a> setup however there should only ever be one SOP for your entire organization. While clients may create their own SOP and you may assist them by providing the strategy and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">documentation framework</a> to do this, that SOP has nothing to do with you the MSP and the reality is, you should not have any input into the clients SOP creation.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your organization the standard operating procedures may need a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">full time resource</a> to keep them up to date and complete. Below 50 staff it likely requires a few <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">hours per week</a> and then a sliding scale above that until around 100 staff and at that point it starts to become a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">full time job</a> for someone.</p>
<p>It has been my experience that a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">non technical resource</a> is best suited for this role as it prevents the confusion that occurs in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">technical staff</a> as to where a document goes. A non tech staff member will never consider putting a SOP into the KB but a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">technician</a> may.</p>
<p>Finally, a SOP is generally a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation">prescriptive and formalized</a> way of carrying out something from a very high level. Take <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">offboarding a client</a> for instance. There should be an SOP as well as a KB article for undertaking this.</p>
<p>The SOP will reference with a link to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">top level KB</a> article that will perhaps link to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">specific client</a> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">KB articles</a>. The SOP will be a high level procedure for offboarding a client such as the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm offboarding with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">MSP Client Manager</a></li>
<li>Inform <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">finance department</a> with minimum 30 days notice</li>
<li>Email client following KB article 234232</li>
<li>Follow up with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/voice over ip hardware index">phone call</a> to client within 7 days</li>
<li><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Email client</a> advising removal of agents following KB 4322</li>
<li>Email <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">client offboarding separation</a> form following KB 3267</li>
</ol>
<p>As can be seen from this example, the SOP is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">general internal documentation</a> on how to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp ai adoption that artificial intelligence delivered">strategically undertake</a> a process. It should not vary from client to client or situation to situation. The SOP should be universal in its <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">application</a> whenever in this example, an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">offboarding of a client</a> is to take place.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Document All Operating Procedures - 1</h2>
<p>It matters little if you are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">large MSP</a> that has its own cleaner or you do not have cleaners at all and you have an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">agreement</a> with your landlord to clean your own spaces, there needs to be a standard operating procedure written up on who is responsible, when they are responsible, what areas they are responsible for and how often they are responsible for ensuring the areas your organization occupies are kept clean.</p>
<p>If you have outside cleaners then there should be a SOP on who is responsible for confirming they have undertaken the cleaning, what they have cleaned and if they have undertaken the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">work competently</a>. Failing to do this will mean that you may well come back to an office that does not look out of place on the secret hoarders show and requires fumigation.</p>
<p>A real business needs to operate to the same level regardless as to if the CEO, director or owner has gone away for a month or not.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">SOPs Are Plain Language - 2</h2>
<p>Ensure that your SOPs are written so they are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">easily understood</a> by a person that has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">no specialist training</a>. An example would be, say there is an SOP that explains the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">client onboarding process</a> then that Standard operating procedure should be written so that it can be understood by the cleaner.</p>
<p>They may not be able to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">carry out the steps</a> that point to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">specific KB articles</a> that the SOP refers to but they should be able to comprehend what the SOP is asking to be done. By adhering to this rule, you guarantee that you do not trip up and assume an SOP is written whereby only half the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">target audience</a> understands what needs to be done.</p>
<p>By always writing for the least <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">knowledgeable</a>, least experienced and lowest common denominator, you guarantee it can be comprehended by anyone that needs to follow it.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Assign Single Primary Contact - 3</h2>
<p>Even if you have just started your own MSP it may be just you or one other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">staff member</a>, ensure the role of managing standard operating procedures is not shared. My advice is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">not to delegate</a> it when you are at such an early stage and regardless of your size, if you are embarking on a SOP creation for the first time then the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">company leadership</a> should drive the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/general diagram topics/project diagram tool">project</a>.</p>
<p>This is because only the leadership knows what a SOP should be. Say you get to the point where there are 3 to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">5 staff</a> and you have advised everyone that works for you that it is important that when they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">visit a client site</a>, they must wear a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">tie and white shirt</a>.</p>
<p>Now you bring on a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">senior tech</a> and never had the chance to induct him correctly and after being away at a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">virtualization conference</a> for a week you find out he has been <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">attending client sites</a> willy nilly without a tie and even worse, a pink shirt.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">who is at fault</a> here? The cause of this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/best effort and msp liability">significant disaster</a> has to fall back on you and the lack of having a written SOP on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">dress code</a>.</p>
<p>It falls back onto you to write the initial SOP because you know what you want the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">dress code</a> to be and nobody else can read your mind. This is one example out of hundreds where when your organization is small, you can get away without having standard operating procedures.</p>
<p>Nobody has the vision of how you want the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">company you lead</a> to operate and without writing it down on your own, nobody else ever will.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Formatting And Consistency Are Vital - 4</h2>
<p>This is linked to the point above and an added reason to have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">single person responsible</a> for the creation and maintenance of the standard operating procedures.</p>
<p>It is a problem that has plagued all organizations, it is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">problem continually downplayed</a> by staff tasked with maintaining both SOPs and KBs and that is ensuring whatever is written is done in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/list of high profile backup failures by msps">consistent manner</a> both in how it is created, the fonts, the spacing, whether to use bullet points or numbers and where to use bold text or colored text.</p>
<p>An example is in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">ITGlue</a>, you can directly insert photos into the text area or you can use the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">photo album feature</a>. While I prefer to directly insert photos, it is not so much important which method you use, it is only important that you consistently use the same method every time.</p>
<p>Having multiple standard operating procedures that are radically different from each other guarantees that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">people will not trust them</a> and as a result will not use them.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Writing Style Should Be The Same - 5</h2>
<p>Yes you should have a standard operating procedure that outlines the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">writing style</a> to be used. This includes the type of words that will be used, length of paragraphs and the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">general framework</a> that each SOP will adhere to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">radically different writing styles</a> where one SOP is short and to the point with as few words as possible to convey a message and then the next looks like it has been written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy">Tom Clancy</a> is not conducive to establishing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">trust among your staff</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Implement An Approvals Process - 6</h2>
<p>Even if you are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">one man operation</a>, put an approval process in place so that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">as you scale</a>, it allows you to scale as fast as is required. Ideally a single person would have been responsible for implementing whatever SOP structure you currently have in place.</p>
<p>Standard operating procedures however often change over time. Once you have the core SOP structure in place then ensuring that there is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">rigid approvals process</a> so that changes are handled the same way every time is very important.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">IT Glue</a>, I used the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp documentation apps overview">workflow module</a> to create a flagging system for SOPs that included triggers with webhooks in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Microsoft Teams</a> for when SOPs needed a review, to be archived or updated so that multiple personnel from multiple departments were able to make proposed changes while allowing the final signoff to be controlled by an individual familiar with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">framework</a> that needs to be adhered to.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Implement A Naming Convention - 7</h2>
<p>Invest time ideally at the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">planning stage</a> of implementing your standard operating procedure platform or retroactively at some point during its <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">early growth phase</a>.</p>
<p>I hear so many complaints about various <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">applications' search ability</a> and my view on this is that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">search bar</a> should be treated as a backup. You should build the SOP naming structure with the view that a search bar does not exist.</p>
<p>By doing this it forces you to come up with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/what msp app to use for client documentation">naming convention</a> that is both logical and easy to navigate. I like to break up the SOP into each major company section such as Finance/Engineering/Sales etc.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Consistently Review Usage Of SOP Articles - 8</h2>
<p>All leading <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">IT documentation platforms</a> have a pathway to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/application purchase and cloud-based subscription fees">view their usage</a>. Keeping an eye on how often SOP articles are used by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">your employees</a> is important. If nobody is using them then something is wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either the articles are written and published in an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">untrustworthy way</a>, employees do not know of their existence or perhaps there is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">no discouragement</a> for doing the wrong thing in your organization among many others.</p>
<p>The point is, you need <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">analytics</a> to establish if there is a problem before you begin trying to figure out what the problem is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/what msp app to use for client documentation">documentation platform</a> or yours does not have the ability then I strongly recommend investing in one. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Hudu</a> for instance can be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">purchased quite reasonably</a> with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">low license count</a>. I suppose I do not see it as practical for MSPs to be operating in today's market without a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/what msp app to use for client documentation">documentation management platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Market Your Standard Operating Procedures To Staff - 9</h2>
<p>I have on occasion been shown an organization's SOPs that in reality end up being a cobbled together <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">group of articles</a> written over a decade that are wildly dissimilar in both their writing style and format located in a nondescript <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">Sharepoint folder</a> called &ldquo;<em>Operations</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody knew where it was until I asked and the standard operating procedures written were <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">often outdated</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">plain wrong</a>. It is frustrating to note that someone at some point invested countless hours working on a company's SOPs only to have them shoved away in a dark corner and forgotten the moment &ldquo;<em>real work</em>&rdquo; like a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/microsoft-teams-integration">new project</a> or client needed attending to.</p>
<p>It is important that you engage in a consistent and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">ongoing marketing campaign</a> to both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">new employees</a> as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">long term staff</a>. Links to the SOP located on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp application stacks-index-page">every app</a> they use within the business where appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">signature management software</a> then setting up all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">internal emails</a> to have a link to your organization's standard operating procedures is a great idea. If you are really keen, throw it on the coffee cups too, whatever you can do to ensure that the SOP is always at the forefront of each one of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employees</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Regular Maintenance Of SOPs - 10</h2>
<p>It can be frustrating when I go into a new organization and am pointed in the direction of their SOP to find out that there are references to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">head office</a> they moved from 5 years ago or Margerie the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">finance lady</a> who <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">retired in the late 90s</a> is directly referenced.</p>
<p>To help with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">regular maintenance</a> of a SOP, it is important to ensure that it is never personalized. People move and companies move offices. This is where a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">documentation platform</a> makes it a bit easier because these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">changing pieces of information</a> are always independent of the SOP article itself.</p>
<p>Still even then people will occasionally write variable or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">changing information</a> directly into a SOP. Always use tags for these types of information so that if it does change then the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">tagged information</a> is updated during the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">offboarding</a> or moving process and the SOP always points towards <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">accurate information</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of the organization a SOP <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting statistics on msp hardware purchasing">should be reviewed</a> anywhere from daily to monthly but never more than that regardless of size. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top 36 applications and solutions for automotive">Proposed updates</a> or additions should be put in place so that the SOP does not become stale.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that if your standard operating procedure becomes stale and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">your staff</a> are either tripped up when <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">trusting something</a> that has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">become inaccurate</a> or noticing errors before acting on them, then they will stop using the SOP due to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">lack of trust</a> these events cause. It takes very few instances where an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employee is let down</a> by the information to stop relying on it.</p>
<p>Ultimately what is the point of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">reading a procedure</a> if there is a chance it is going to be wrong anyway, much easier just to ask someone that knows right? Of course that wastes the time of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employee</a> looking to undertake the process as well as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">staff member</a> who has to stop what they are doing and explain what needs to be done.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Regardless of size, I hope this article has convinced you to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">invest time</a> and effort into some type of standard operating procedure structure in your organization.</p>
<p>The two takeaways here are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">scalability</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">sale price</a>. If you are on the smaller size, I am assuming you want to grow? This requires scalability both up and down as and when the market dictates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By having a SOP you can <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">onboard new staff</a> faster and with more confidence and less cost than if you need to invest time in one on one training.</p>
<p>If you are a larger MSP, then the sale price should be on your mind. Sure you may not yet be looking to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">move on or sell</a> but without an SOP, all you have is a glorified job because you need to be available for the whole enterprise to work. This significantly impacts upon <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">sale price</a> of any business especially MSPs.</p>
