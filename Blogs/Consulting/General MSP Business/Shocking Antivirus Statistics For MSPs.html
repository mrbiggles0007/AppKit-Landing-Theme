<p>A collection of shocking stats on Antivirus strategies for MSPs along with other intrusion risks such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">malware and ransomware</a> will be the topic of today&rsquo;s article and I will also list a few gold nuggets of information that may help you implement a couple of useful <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/mssps - index">countermeasures</a> into your own environment.</p>
<p>No doubt you are aware that the technology and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">MSP industry</a> is targeted more than any other sector with 25% of reported virus intrusions in 2023 leaving the second most targeted industry in the dust which is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">financial industry</a> which collectively made up 7% of the total intrusion attempts.</p>
<p>Join me on this terrifying ride as I detail the unrelenting and overwhelming <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">level of attacks</a> that are going on in an attempt to take <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">profit out of your pocket</a> and put it in the pocket of unpleasant individuals devoid of humanity.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Kim Jong Un And The Seven Dwarfs</h2>
<p>It is hard to reconcile, this jolly fat man with his humorous smile, all I want to do is rub his belly and throw him in the trunk as my lucky charm however, he is not the passive tummy rubbing lucky charm we would like to imagine him being, no, turns out, he is not actually very nice.</p>
<p>North Korea is the largest and most aggressive source of state sponsored virus based intrusion attempts &amp; they tend to specifically target the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">financial sector</a>. This of course includes technology organizations that support both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">Financial SaaS applications</a> as well as MSPs that focus on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">financial organizations</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Kerberoasting Intrusion Method</h2>
<p>Kerberoasting, which attacks the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)">Kerberos protocol</a>, is the offline <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security vulnerability overview">bruteforce cracking</a> method used to break in using the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security stack overview">kerberos authentication protocol</a>. This is about the most used <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security services overview">protocol</a> when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Microsoft Windows OS devices</a> and works off of a ticket granting methodology.</p>
<p>The faceless individuals of low moral fiber will crack tickets that are associated with service principal names which are assigned to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">Active Directory accounts</a>. Once these cretins break the code, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">plain text passwords</a> are unceremoniously unsheathed. Because the processing and grunt work is done offline by shady little men in dark rooms we don't like talking about, they actually do not need <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security resources overview">elevated privileges</a> to carry out this style of attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is quite insidious because they often target <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/operating systems-index">service accounts</a> which of course do not have quite the visibility of normal <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">domain admin accounts</a> and yet often carry the same level of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">permissions</a>. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/operating systems-index">Services accounts</a> also tend to generate impossibly large amounts of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">log entries</a> that nobody actually takes notice of. It really is a dreadful situation.</p>
<p>Once these morally bankrupt individuals gain access this way, you may as well drop your trousers and prepare yourself for a very unpleasant experience.</p>
<p>There is a silver lining however, actually that is a lie, there is nothing to balance out the bad news and because these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security vulnerabilities - index">viral attacks</a> are so effective they have increased since they were first reported in 2022 by around 700%, I suppose the silver lining is at least it is not 1400%.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Kerberoasting Countermeasures</h2>
<p>While it is true, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)">kerberoasting</a> sounds like something you do with marshmallows around a campfire, it is actually a nasty little monster but I can at least impart a few techniques that you can apply to reduce the chance of being assaulted by this type of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security stack - index">threat</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">3rd Party Windows Logs Tools</h4>
<p>Get your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">credit card</a> out and pay for a half <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">decent application</a> that will help sort through all of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">junk log files</a> that are created so that you can competently filter them which will allow you to be alerted quickly and so you can respond like a coiled spring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know what you are thinking "<em>We will just get Damo the </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index"><em>Level 1 support desk</em></a><em> guy to read through the logs for 30 minutes each day&rdquo;</em> or even better have our RMM tool trigger on certain event IDs (4769 and 4771)</p>
<p>If you trust your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">RMM</a> to send alerts straight to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">support email queue</a> then that could work however as far as Damo is concerned, nobody should be made to manually look through <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/operating systems-index">windows log files</a>, it is bordering on inhumane. It is straight up inefficient and threats are likely to be overlooked or missed. There are plenty of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">quality applications</a> that do a great job of monitoring and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">filtering log files</a> if your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">RMM tool</a> cannot handle this task.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Show Me The Honey</h4>
<p>You know the drill, set up a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">sacrificial VM</a> in front of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">production machines</a> with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">easy passwords</a> and a big bow wrapped around it. Then pay particular attention to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">log files</a> on this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/virtual machine index">virtual machine</a> looking for the relevant <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Event IDs</a>. Ensure that the service tickets are automatically triggered on the selected <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">eventIDs</a> and ensure that the ticket is set to a high priority.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">RC4 Encryption Priority</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4">RC4</a> is well known as being quite a pushover in that it is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">insecure</a>. Either disable RC4 or ensure any EventIDs relating to RC4 traffic triggers a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">support ticket</a> with a high priority. RC4 is EventID 4769. Where you can, try and use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">AES Kerberos encryption</a> as it is much stronger than RC4.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Auditing SPN Registered Service Accounts</h4>
<p>These are the types of accounts most at risk of this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security incidents msp - index">type of attack</a>. Audit them and act accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Cloud Instance Metadata API Hoovering</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">Cloud instance</a> metadata APIs are often used by retrobates to gather <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/mssp overview">secret keys</a> and various credentials and this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/mssps - index">infiltration type</a> has increased by 170% year on year since 2019 (back when the world was normal)</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Pass The Hash Attacks</h2>
<p>Pass The Hash Attacks have nothing to do with people sporting dreadlocks and owning a couple of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley_and_the_Wailers_discography">Bob Marley records</a>. It is an attack where someone pilfers a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security applications - index">hashed user credential</a> and is able to use that hashed credential without actually needing to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security resources - index">crack it</a>. It deceives the system into creating a second <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">authenticated AD session</a>.</p>
<p>Pass-the-hash attacks have seen a year on year rise of 230%</p>
<p>Pass the Hash falls under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Lateral_Movement">lateral movement technique</a> which to use an analogy, is like when a thief has the keys to your house and uses them to break in and then after breaking in is able to steal your car keys, that is the best way I can describe it.</p>
<p>So the attackers are already inside and they then use Pass the hash attacks to unlock other things.</p>
<p>Often the low life scoundrels will breach your fortress of solitude using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">remote access</a> usually triggered using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security services - index">malware or a virus</a> and once in, they then crab walk from account to account until like solving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube">rubik's cube</a>, they obtain access to an account like a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">domain admin</a> account with which they can then do whatever they damn well please.</p>
<p>The Achilles heel when it comes to these attacks is the SSO or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">single sign-on</a> that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Windows</a> uses where it <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">caches credentials</a> so they can be used across <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Hardware/TOP LEVEL PAGES/Workstations">multiple machines</a> by a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">single sign-on</a> action.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Pass The Hash Countermeasures</h2>
<p>Pretty depressing isn't it? I have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">been in IT</a> for 20 years and would have a great deal of difficulty <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rackmount computers">accessing my computer</a> if I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">forgot my password</a> and yet it just seems these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">hackers</a> are unstoppable if they decide you are a viable target. I will however give a few tips on counteracting this attack. While I do enjoy putting the fear of god into people, it is always good to balance things out with a few positives.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Lock Down Domain Controllers</h4>
<p>It is recommended to lock down <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">domain controllers</a> so that they can only be accessed via <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">trusted systems</a> without <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">internet access</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah right....Of the 400 or so clients or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">clients of clients</a> I have worked with over the last 10 years I can think of only one client that even came close to implementing that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">level of security</a> and that was a large water supply company on the west coast and even then I was able to access their DC via <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">RDP</a> once I logged in to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Hardware/TOP LEVEL PAGES/Workstations">local workstation</a> using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Control</a>.</p>
<p>Still, these days, we are no longer playing games out there and some sacrifices likely need to be made on the usability side of things. This is where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">onsite visits</a> may need to be reviewed and deployed once more.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Two Factor Authentication</h4>
<p>This is sort of a given these days, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security applications overview">2FA with tokens</a> needs to be activated in every area where it is an option. I am a massive fan of the <a href="https://duo.com/">Duo 2FA authentication application</a>, once setup it really is a breeze to use and to date it has never let me down both for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">service techs</a> as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client use</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Principle Of Least Privilege</h4>
<p>This is a bit like the old need to know protocol where a person is only given access to the material they need to do the job they need to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When setup correctly, it is a great system but it means users need to be users, no <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">local admin privileges</a>, no ability to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp application stacks-index-page">add remove programs</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">support staff</a> should not really have unfettered access to run every single <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">powershell script</a> on the planet, random <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rugged computers">batch files</a> found off of some suspicious looking utility site should be restricted to a single account, things like that.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">3rd Party Windows Logs Tools</h4>
<p>Either your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">RMM alerting tool</a> or a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/vertical apps-index">third party windows log analysis tool</a> is again a great component of your overall suite of defense measures that you can use in increasing the odds of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/mssps - index">early detection</a>.</p>
<p>It is a lot of work and takes a lot of planning but once it is dialed in, in theory, you can even run <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Hardware/TOP LEVEL PAGES/Workstations">desktops</a> without <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security vulnerabilities - index">virus scanners</a> if you wanted to live life on the edge and you could probably get away with it too (That is humor).</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Fun Fact 1</h4>
<p>97% of 2,000 businesses surveyed in 2019 had experienced an intrusion that involved a pass the hash attack.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Fun Fact 2</h4>
<p>40% of the aforementioned businesses suffered some form of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">financial loss</a> due to the successful intrusion.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Fun Fact 3</h4>
<p>75% of the businesses ended up with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">increased operational costs</a> (think <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">Cyber Insurance Policy</a> and bolstered <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security stack - index">threat detectio</a>n among other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">increased costs</a>)</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Fun Fact 4</h4>
<p>There is approximately one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/mssps - index">potential intrusion event</a> every seven minutes occurring in a business of average size today.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Fun Fact 5</h4>
<p>There has been a 44% year on year increase in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/mssps - index">intrusion attempts</a> across all businesses.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AD CS Abuse</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/ad-cs">Active directory certificate services</a> are another <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">attack vector</a> commonly used when they have been either misconfigured or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">obtaining privilege escalation</a> <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/nas vs san">using a SAN</a> with the right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate">EKU</a>. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">Powershell</a> is often recruited to run under the radar.</p>
<p>I do not really pretend to understand this particular intrusion as it is quite complex, however the best way to ensure protection is to check and double check that your AD CS does not have any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">misconfigurations</a> and should always be running the latest agent and content version.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">AD CS Abuse Countermeasures</h2>
<p>Rather than attempting to explain how to harden your environment against these sorts of attacks, I am just going to link to a really good <a href="https://mandiant.widen.net/s/ld7gszw89z/active-directory-certificate-services-hardening-mandiant">whitepaper</a> that steps you through the <a href="https://mandiant.widen.net/s/ld7gszw89z/active-directory-certificate-services-hardening-mandiant">mitigation and hardening process here</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Remote Monitoring Tools Used By Virus Infiltration</h2>
<p>Below is a table of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">remote monitoring tools</a> from most used to least used out of the 14% of intrusions where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">RMM tools</a> were used. The most common form of infiltration when RMMs are used is with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">Powershell scripts</a>.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">RMM Intrusion Countermeasures</h2>
<h4 class="display-4">Allow List</h4>
<p>Take the time to create an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/hardware apps-index">application allow list</a>. This prevents <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security stack overview">unauthorized application execution</a> within the MSP and or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client environment</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">General Application Monitoring</h4>
<p>Ensure <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">monitoring</a> for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">unauthorized application execution</a> is set up through your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">RMM alert console</a> and if possible create a blocklist of known <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">RMM tools</a> that you do not use and that have no business <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/thin clients">running on endpoints</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/servers index">servers</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Firewall Modification</h4>
<p>RMM tools will often <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">modify software firewall settings</a> when they are first installed and this will occur automatically. It is recommended to ensure you have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">monitoring setup</a> of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">software firewalls</a> and a configuration standard so that any changes that are made get reported back to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">support desk</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Hardware Firewall Access</h4>
<p>Lock it down tight and if the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">RMM app</a> permits, modify <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/consumer routers">default port numbers</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/consumer routers index">change protocols</a> where possible so that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">scanning applications</a> will have a tougher time. It is always a good idea to use ports other than standard <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">TCP/UDP ports</a> when configuring your RMM or any apps for that matter.</p>
<p>Put effort into curating your allow lists and deny everything not explicitly in the allow list.</p>
<p>It takes time but is worth the effort.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Cloud Computing Is The Pretty Girl At The Dance</h2>
<p>There has been a 110% year on year increase in virus and infiltration threats specifically aimed at <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud based infrastructure</a>. The tough part with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/msp cloud backups for workstations">online cloud infrastructure</a> is the complexities involved in setting it up correctly in a way that can competently defend against viruses and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security vulnerabilities - index">ransomware</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Cloud Computing Intrusion Countermeasures</h2>
<p>There are a number of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">complex threats</a> aimed specifically at <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers">online computing services</a> and realistically there is a higher level of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">technical competence required</a> to ensure that a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/should msps backup google workspace">cloud environment</a> is set up in the most secure way possible.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Treat The Cloud The Same As Local</h4>
<p>Now is not the time to put your guard down, there are as much if not more risks involved with running your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">infrastructure</a> from a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud platform</a> as there is from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">running hardware locally</a>.</p>
<p>Treat <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network firewalls index">firewalls</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network switch index">switches</a> with the same level of restriction as you would <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-local-index">locally</a>. Create an allow list and block all other traffic. Have a process for the approval of opening ports through the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network firewalls index">network firewall</a>.</p>
<p>Also by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network switch index">denying outgoing traffic</a> (to your office) other than <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">approved ports</a>, it makes it much more difficult for the attackers to successfully extract the stolen information from the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud location</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">3rd Party Best Of Bread Security Apps</h4>
<p>Investing in something like<a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/cloud-native-application-protection-platform-cnapp/"> CrowdStrike&rsquo;s cloud native application</a> platform protection takes the guesswork out of your current risk and provides visibility to ongoing attempts to infiltrate your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud network</a>. Spend money on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">good quality applications</a> and it is likely it will end up more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">cost effective</a> than wasting excessive labor on doing it manually.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Other Miscellaneous Antivirus Stats&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Below are a few nuggets of information that quite frankly was news to me. I always thought <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Linux</a> was impossible to crack. At least that is what I picked up over the years from a collection of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=soap dodgers">shower dodgers</a> who would rant for no less than 15 minutes at a time about how great <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Unix</a> is.</p>
<p>Well now I know, it suffers the same security and virus issues as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Windows operating systems</a> do.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Linux Virus Statistics</h4>
<p>It is probably no surprise to know that the biggest industry where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Linux</a> is targeted is technology/MSPs followed closely by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">telecommunications</a> and then a very distant third is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/scientific &amp; laboratory computer hardware">Academic organizations</a>.</p>
<p>Bash and PAM are the most common vectors of attack.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">MAC OS Virus Statistics</h4>
<p>I would have bet money that the most affected sector regarding <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/msp managed mac backups">MAC OS</a> virus infections would have been either <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/scientific &amp; laboratory computer hardware">education</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">desktop design</a> and yet it is actually the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">financial sector</a> by a significant margin.<br />I had no idea that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/msp managed mac backups">MACs</a> were utilized so much in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">financial sector</a> and the impact to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">finance organizations</a> is about twice as high as the second on the list which is technology/MSP organizations.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is no doubt at all that we are seeing a massive surge in instances of virus infections, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">malware and ransomware</a>, not only an increase in instances but a massive surge in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">financial cost</a> to businesses these events are causing.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that in today&rsquo;s environment it is absolutely a requirement to operate under the cover of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">good quality cyber insurance policy</a>. That does not mean you can slacken off and not continue to implement sensible countermeasures to prevent the worst occurring but it means you can rest easy knowing that you have the big guns in the background if needed.</p>
<p>I also advocate for making it a mandatory requirement that all clients take out their own <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">cyber insurance policy</a> and I go into more detail as to why in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">article here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
