<div data-linkz-ai-container>
<p>Today&rsquo;s article will look into why so many service providers are making the decision to move from class leading PSAs such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Atera</a> and Autotask over to a relative newcomer called Halo PSA.</p>
<p>It is a highly customizable <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">professional services automation tool</a> that is able to be integrated into other areas of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">MSP stack</a>. That is where its strength lies, if it cannot be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">integrated out of the box</a> then it has the ability through its API to have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">customized configuration</a> setup so that it will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">integrate</a> with whatever <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">application</a> you need it to.</p>
<p>I will take a look at its features including areas such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">contract terms</a> and compare them to other professional services automation options currently available. I will also look at any negatives that service providers have found after having made the move across.</p>
<p>I am going to list some of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">negatives first</a> because then it saves you reading the entire article only to find one of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">negative points</a> prevents it being considered. Make no mistake, Halo PSA is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">complex piece of software</a> however with complexity comes power and it is in many ways far more powerful than the likes of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="display-6">HaloPSA Disadvantages</h2>
<p>As mentioned, I thought it best to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">list the disadvantages</a> first because if they are deal breakers, then it saves a bit of reading. I want to make it clear though that HaloPSA is the best PSA on the market today if you can get past the disadvantages.</p>
<p>I like to think of an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">MSP stack</a> as a hub and spoke type of arrangement where the PSA sits in the center as the hub and all other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp application stacks-index-page">MSP applications</a> sit out on the edge of each spoke. While some of those <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">applications</a> talk to each other directly, in basically all circumstances, the PSA will be the fortress of solitude with which the rest of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">applications</a> will interface with.</p>
<p>This means that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">integration</a> is the single most important function of any PSA. As far as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">integration</a> goes, no other PSA comes close, they are not even playing the same game. So it is important to have that in mind when reading through its <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">disadvantages</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Minimum License Count</h4>
<p>While a 3 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/application purchase and cloud-based subscription fees">user count</a> is the minimum, because they have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">grown significantly</a> in the recent past, last time I checked, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">minimum license count</a> that a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">new customer</a> could purchase was 15 seats to enable access to mandatory <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">onboarding consulting</a>.</p>
<p>This effectively means there is a 15 seat minimum going directly with HaloPSA but there is an <a href="https://ezpcltd.com/halo/">authorized HaloPSA partner</a> called <a href="https://ezpcltd.com/halo/">EZPC</a> who offers single HaloPSA licenses. I have not actually used them, however they have a really good name amongst the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16owexv/halopsa_onboarding/">MSP community</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a minimum of 10 hours <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">onboarding support</a> required which may seem <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">unreasonable</a> however due to its complexity, in my mind, this is an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">excellent initiative</a> that is worth every cent.</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of HaloPSA, you can complete a task seven different ways. Personally, I really like it when I am <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising facts about managed backups with managed service providers">not restricted</a> to doing something one way, however you need to accept that when something is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top 36 applications and solutions for automotive">highly customizable</a> that it will be more complex especially at the onboarding stage.</p>
<p>Also to note, when compared to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Manage</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Autotask</a>, it is quite a bit <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">more expensive</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Steep Learning Curve</h4>
<p>Halo PSA has a very <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp ai adoption that artificial intelligence delivered">steep learning curve</a> when compared to PSA&rsquo;s such as Connectwise and Autotask. Moving from one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">major component</a> of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">MSP stack</a> to another is already a massive undertaking. The cost is almost always far greater than the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">outright measurable cost</a>.</p>
<p>Most MSPs do not factor in the handicap your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">entire organization</a> faces as they grapple with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">new piece of software</a>. They do not count the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">problems with integration</a> or the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">training costs</a> required. The reason most service providers do not count these intangibles is because if they did, nobody would ever move to another PSA.</p>
<p>Now take the above and understand that Halo PSA has an even <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">steeper learning curve</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Halo PSA Documentation Is Poor</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">tech documentation</a> for Halo PSA seems to be about 50% complete at the time of writing this. It has appeared to be in an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">unacceptable state</a> for many years leading me to the view that this is intentional so that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">onboard consulting</a> is always in demand.</p>
<p>It can be very <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">frustrating to onboard</a> even a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp documentation apps overview">simple application</a> when it is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">missing key information</a> on how or why to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting statistics on msp hardware purchasing">set up components</a> a certain way. However when you have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">highly complex</a> PSA that could be very powerful if you just knew the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">right path</a> to take if it was <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/list of high profile backup failures by msps">written down</a>, it can be very frustrating.</p>
<p>We have all at some point sat there for 10 hours <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">trying to solve a problem</a> that would have taken minutes if it had been <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">documented properly</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Connectwise Manage To HaloPSA Import</h4>
<p>While difficult, it has in the past been possible to migrate all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">old service tickets</a> from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Manage</a> across to HaloPSA. Recently Connectwise <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">changed their terms</a> so that exporting your information using their API to another platform is no longer allowed.</p>
<p>My view is this is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">short term disadvantage</a> but demonstrates the attitude that Connectwise have towards their customers and actually demonstrates why moving away from a company that behaves in this way is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">smart move</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear this means either <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">continuing to pay</a> for at least one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">CW Manage license</a> so that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">old tickets</a> can be referenced or you can set up some type of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">reference source</a> using the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client expectations on enterprise backup solutions">flat file export</a> you get out of CW Manage. It is not ideal of course but in my view, the anger of CW engaging in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">ransom tactics</a> outweighs the pain of having to set up some type of ticket archive.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">HaloPSA Email Polling Intervals</h4>
<p>When HaloPSA was first released, it had a 5 minute polling minimum which was a disadvantage some found hard to overcome.</p>
<p>Since this point however, HaloPSA have completely overhauled the email processing functionality to a set of micro-services allowing for webhook-based immediate email processing.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why it is under disadvantages, it is nothing to do with me being too lazy to move it to the advantages, I think I am going to leave it here as an example of where HaloPSA had an issue with their product, they listened to the feedback of their customers and applied an update to overcome the limitation.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">HaloPSA Vendor Organizations</h4>
<p>HaloPSA cannot relate tickets to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">Suppliers</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">Vendors</a> meaning you need to add them as clients so that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">tickets</a> can be applied. For many this is not a big deal but certainly the way I have always worked is that I have a clear delineation between <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">clients</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendors</a> especially for information syncing to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Hudu or IT Glue</a> so this would mean a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">significant change</a>.</p>
<p>Currently if you have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">Vendor setup</a> in HaloPSA with the right name and the exact email address for them and an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">email</a> comes in from them it will be assigned to the &ldquo;<em>Unknown</em>&rdquo; company.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">HaloPSA Advantages</h2>
<p>Now we can look at the advantages that moving to HaloPSA offers and why so many <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">service providers</a> are moving away from the old favorites like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Connectwise Manage</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Autotask</a>.</p>
<p>To me it is a little sad considering my first PSA was a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">server based version</a> of Connectwise. To watch it go from an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/vertical apps-index">application created</a> with a huge amount of love and dedication by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arniebellini">Arnie Bellini</a> where if you did the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">training courses</a>, he would be in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">room teaching</a> to where it is now which is a soulless wasteland who&rsquo;s sole existence is to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">generate money</a> for a faceless <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">private equity firm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, onto the advantages.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">10 Year Sale Guarantee</h4>
<p>How many of us have been <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">bitten by Kaseya</a> or large private equity firms that go around buying our favorite <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">MSP application</a> companies only to have them either strip and destroy them so as to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">eliminate competition</a> for their existing product or eliminate the development, decimate the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">support team</a> and jack the prices up while <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">modifying contracts</a> so they are incredibly unfair?</p>
<p>Many have been <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">burnt numerous times</a> with this. HaloPSA have recently stated that they promise not to sell the company for 10 years which is a lifetime in the MSP world. I know what you are thinking &ldquo;<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction"><em>Companies lie</em></a><em> all the time, I know I am a </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup"><em>Kaseya client</em></a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are <a href="https://halopsa.com/thehaloway/">adding this to their contracts</a> as of 13th June 2024 and what is even better is that it is a rolling 10 year period meaning that if they ever stop putting this in their contract, the day they remove it means you will still have a 10 year countdown from that date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://halopsa.com/thehaloway/"><em>Name the name, they&rsquo;ve tried to buy us &ndash; and our answer is always the same. We&rsquo;re only focused on our commitment to create change in the industry. So as of 13th June 2024, we&rsquo;re adding to our contracts that we will not be involved in any mergers, acquisitions, or private equity deals for a rolling 10-year period.</em></a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now all we need is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Hudu</a> to do the same thing and we can all rest easy.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">HaloPSA Included Modules</h4>
<p>Who else has woken up one morning and come to the realization that the number of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">MSP applications</a> you are paying for has reached a level of absurdity that cannot be ignored?</p>
<p>I preface this by saying that usually the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">internal and included modules</a> with any PSA are usually a far cry from the paid <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">3rd party options</a> and I do think that if you are used to using something like Zomentum then it is unlikely the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">included functionality</a> is going to satisfy your requirements.</p>
<p>Below are just a few of the the current tools that you can <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">potentially eliminate</a> and that have a functional replacement within HaloMSP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zomentum</li>
<li>Cloud Radial</li>
<li>Cognito Forms</li>
<li>Zapier</li>
<li>Third Party Accounting Sync Tools</li>
<li>Teams/Slack Bots</li>
<li>Third Party SMS Tools</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="display-4">HaloPSA Rapid Development</h4>
<p>Lets face it, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">regular development cycles</a> with products like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">ITGlue</a> and across the board have become a joke.</p>
<p>The most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">requested features</a> area of many <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">MSP applications</a> seems to be more about finding out what new <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">standalone product</a> the organization can create and sell than a constant improvement towards the product you are paying for.</p>
<p>HaloPSA has <a href="https://halopsa.com/halopsa-new-features-q2-2024/">major updates quarterly</a> however there is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">constant cycle</a> of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">minor updates</a> to the application that appear to occur daily. If you are a thrill seeker you can also turn on the beta cycle of updates as well.</p>
<p>What is impressive here is that the updates that are done <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">quarterly</a> are always substantial as in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">good number of updates</a> that include substantial features instead of the abysmal excuse for an update that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">IT Glue</a> comes out with and while I realize <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">Kaseya</a> owns them, they were actually pretty dreadful prior to that occurring.</p>
<p>This feels like a company that is enthusiastic about their product and they most certainly appear to have enough <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">developers</a> to attack the day to day bugs but are also able to create <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">significant improvements</a> on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/hardware apps overview">base platform</a>. What is even better is unlike <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">Kaseya</a>, they do not try to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">invoice you for a feature</a> by calling it a different product.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">HaloPSA Interface Speed</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/cables &amp; adapters">interface</a> for HaloPSA for both the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liabilities of hosting client backups">self hosted</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/baas overview">hosted versions</a> are significantly faster than both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Manage</a> or Autotask. Not only in the response speed of the interface but someone has sat down and planned out the most effective way to do many of the tasks we do day to day in our PSA.</p>
<p>This means instead of having to go through 20 clicks and have 7 windows open to get something done, it will take 3 clicks and it is all within one browser window.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="display-4">HaloPSA Integration Capabilities</h4>
<p>This is up there as far as qualities that sets it apart from other PSAs. The issue I have always found with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">Professional services automation software</a> is that they tend to attempt to focus on too many things and the end result is that the actual PSA itself just ends up being very average.</p>
<p>What HaloPSA does better than any other PSA that I can think of is that they seem to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">invest more time</a> in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">core product</a> while allowing other applications that are specialist in their area to integrate. For example they do not have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">built in RMM</a> however they do integrate pretty well with most leading RMM tools.</p>
<p>It seems that <a href="https://www.ninjaone.com/">NinjaOne</a> has the best integration according to the majority of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halopsa/comments/10n5xt1/rmm_only_to_integrate_with_halopsa/">MSP community</a>.</p>
<p>Here is their <a href="https://halopsa.com/integrations/">integrations page</a> although just be aware that some integrations such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/oracle zero data loss recovery appliance vs acronis cyber appliance">Acronis</a> can be half baked and not what most of us would consider a full integration.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>MSPs are moving across from the more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">traditional PSAs</a> to HaloPSA because it wipes the floor with them due its ability to allow for infinite customization and its power to integrate with other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">MSP applications</a>.</p>
<p>Not just that, for some time now there has been a stink emanating from the larger vendors such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">Kaseya</a> where they are not trying to hide how little they spend on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">product development</a> or the tactics they use to obtain and keep MSPs with them.</p>
<p>MSPs really have had enough of being treated in this way especially considering we tend to be a pretty loyal bunch and helped many of these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendors</a> to get where they are today. If you can look past the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation">lack of documentation</a> and the vastly more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">complex onboarding</a> learning curve then it really is worth the effort to make the move.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact they provide a rolling 10 year guarantee not to sell the company is a refreshing acknowledgement to the pain previous vendors have put us through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Couple that with regular substantial feature releases and I am finding it difficult to find any reason not to move to HaloPSA when the appropriate time arrives where your organization is looking to make a change to their PSA.</p>
