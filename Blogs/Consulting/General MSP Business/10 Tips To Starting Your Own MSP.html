<p>I am going to discuss the top ten tips on starting your own MSP in no particular order. Having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">started my own MSP from scratch</a> in 2004 before selling 12 years later I am often asked about some of the life lessons I have learnt and what I would have done differently.</p>
<p>Out of the group of business owners that I know and socialized with during that time, I definitely got out a little too early as they had similar trajectories as I did and yet most of them are around the 100+ staff size today. I mistakenly believed that the advent of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers">Office365</a> was the writing on the wall along with a difficult period in my life at the same period that saw me turn my back on owning an MSP.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="display-6">Lack Business Experience Or Have Plenty Of It</h2>
<p>There is not much room in between these two extremes. You need to be unaware of how much work and effort it is going to take to reach the point of being successful after starting an MSP.</p>
<p>Alternatively you need to have ideally <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">failed once or twice</a> in the past and have the experience and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">technical knowledge</a> that will allow you to achieve the goals you set out. So working smarter rather than harder.</p>
<p>That long bit in between where you have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">knowledge or ability</a> without the enthusiasm that ignorance brings, that is the area where even though you may have more experience than others, that experience brings with it the knowledge of how much effort is required to overcome all of the hurdles you will face along the way.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Start Small And Stay Small For As Long As Possible</h2>
<p>I made the big mistake of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">going through money</a> like it was going out of fashion. I needed the office close to the CBD and later on moved into the CBD where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">rents were high</a>, I invested in pointless things like $1200 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">help desk chairs</a>, custom built support desk tables not to mention spending 70K on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">Kaseya VSA software</a> along with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">Kaseya security software</a> that never actually worked.</p>
<p>At one point I was spending 35K per month just to open the doors and really had no clue what I was doing.</p>
<p>None of that is needed when you start and learn from my mistake here. You are far better off having a couple of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">small loyal clients</a> who <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">pay bills on time</a> than a bunch of larger clients that are major headaches who <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">never pay their bills on time</a> and are always <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">hunting for discounts</a>.</p>
<p>Spending big dollars on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">class leading applications</a> is not always wise either. I have this mindset that twice the price means twice as good and yet time and time again I see that is such a bad way to think.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">open source MSP applications</a> that will do a good enough job in the early years. Keep your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">costs as low as possible</a> for as long as possible.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Focus On Client Quality</h2>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">Bad clients</a> can send you to the wall so easily either through <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">late or non-payment</a> or their penchant for taking their service providers to court via <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">legal action</a> at the drop of the hat, a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">bad client</a> is far worse than no client at all.</p>
<p>Write an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">MSP business plan</a> down for yourself and give yourself a good 3 year hunting period if possible where you spend time attempting to obtain an arbitrary number of new clients. It could be 20 or 25, the number does not matter so much as does the quality.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/amazing msp facts and figures">sales meetings</a> with the idea of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">interviewing clients</a>. The biggest problem I had was attending sales meetings as if the client was a god. I would be happy if they would throw a few crumbs my way.</p>
<p>Do not do that, go in with confidence. Confidence is not arrogance, go in there with confidence and make it clear to them that you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you.</p>
<p>They donâ€™t have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">managed backup</a>? Why not, how long have they not had one and do they not value that type of service? If it is clear they do not value the cost of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/choosing an msp backup solution">good backup solution</a> then thank them for their time and walk away.</p>
<p>You are searching for clients that will value your skillset and will demonstrate loyalty towards you. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">Client quality</a> means taking on some clients over a short period before either keeping them or eliminating them.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">Slow payers</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">poor communicators</a>, clients that continually devalue tasks like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">good documentation procedures</a> will often not be recognized in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/amazing msp facts and figures">single sales meeting</a>, however take them <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">on-board</a> on a trial basis and if they exhibit bad behavior, cut them loose immediately as you will not change them.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Find a Niche</h2>
<p>In today's <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">technology market</a> you need a niche, things have gotten out of control. I have worked with companies that outsource their level 1 and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">2 support desk</a> to the Philippines and while some are terrible, I have worked with a number that write better English than we can, have got the American accent down so well they train for specific regions, their work ethic exceeds ours by a significant margin all while doing it for quarter the price.</p>
<p>They integrate so well with the service provider that there is actually no discernible difference between who is an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">internal employee</a> and who is outsourced overseas help.</p>
<p>So tell me, how are you going to compete as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">generic MSP service company</a> in that environment? You will find it hard to do so my advice is do not directly compete. Find a niche, it could be something as narrow as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Excel spreadsheet expertise</a> where you and your staff know every single trick in the book when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">Excel</a>.</p>
<p>Focusing on a niche like that opens up the door to offer your other services and that is the best way to operate. Business is built on relationships so you establish that beach head with your niche before rolling out the reinforcements.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Have Clients Sign Agreements</h2>
<p>I heard someone say the other day that they do not make their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">clients sign agreements</a> and they were saying it as if it was some type of badge of honor.</p>
<p>The signed agreements are where the value of your business is and without having them, your clients can easily walk away at a moment's notice all while you carry an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">enormous amount of risk</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that though, a client agreement details to both parties exactly what is expected of them, how they are to engage with each other and how the parties work towards rectifying issues in the event of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">communication breakdown</a>.</p>
<p>Always have a service agreement signed and always invest in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">specialist tech lawyer</a> to look over the wording of your service agreements to ensure they are valid for the state you live in as well as the state the client lives in.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Risk Minimization</h2>
<p>I am talking about <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">cyber insurance policies</a> as well as other risk minimization. Always have an upsell or whatever service you are offering. So as an example, if you offer <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">server hardware</a> then always have a better <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">performing piece of hardware</a> that could be purchased for a higher amount.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">supply hard disk drives</a> then offer <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/ssd vs hdd in nas drives">high end SSDs</a> as an option, not because you think the client will purchase them, it is to reduce your risk by offering a solution that would have solved whatever problem your client is blaming you for.</p>
<p>If you are taken to court because the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">consulting service</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware failed</a> for some reason then demonstrating that you had offered an option that would have prevented the issue occurring can help minimize your responsibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">Newsletters</a> are another great risk minimization, if you regularly update your clients with advice through a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">newsletter</a> then it is a demonstration of you imparting advice that the client has had access to and decided not to take.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Documentation Framework Early On</h2>
<p>Be careful early on signing on to the big guns like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">IT Glue</a>. I really like the product however I am disgusted by the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">business practices</a> of the parent company who will try to lock businesses into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">unfair contracts</a> and seemingly randomly invoice them.</p>
<p>It is easy for a midsize business to carry 5 or 10K in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">unauthorized billing</a> to their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">credit cards</a> as they know once they dispute it, it will eventually be returned. If you have just started up, that sort of money could send you broke or at the least cause a lot of pain.</p>
<p>Start putting in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">documentation strategy</a> early on and make sure that you keep it consistent even if it is just you using it. Have in the back of your mind that you will eventually want to move your home grown system to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">commercially available documentation platform</a> such as Hudu though.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Employ Staff Slowly</h2>
<p>Taking on another <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">staff member</a> beyond yourself is a whole different beast than running a one man show and I strongly recommend that you have at least some leadership experience prior to undertaking it.</p>
<p>I do not mean <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">management experience</a>, anyone can manage others, I am talking about getting that discretionary effort out of people where they want to do extra work for you because they like you.</p>
<p>I would go so far as to say that you probably need to be a naturally good leader to have a chance at growing a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">successful business</a>. This is a time to really analyze how you are viewed by others. Some people tend to offend everyone they meet, if that is you then perhaps running a business that requires getting the most out of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff</a> is not the best option.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">Most people think leadership</a> is the exact opposite of what it actually is. It is about patience, humility, kindness, sacrifice but not just those qualities, executing those qualities at the right time in the right order and knowing when to bare your teeth so you do not get walked over while also making sure you do not foster secret resentment in your staff.</p>
<p>I think everyone as they get older knows if they have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">good leadership skills</a> or not. If you are below 30, you are likely at that point in life where you believe you are capable of anything. All I can recommend is putting some effort into understanding what defines a leader and comparing it to your current attributes, perhaps do a few courses on leadership and you may find that it is a hidden quality that you always had.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Sales Ability</h2>
<p>I think this is closely entwined with leadership. You need to be able to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for generating technical documentation for different audiences (technical vs non-technical)">explain to non technical people</a> why your complex and expensive product or service is something that they need to have in their life to make their own business run more efficiently with less headaches.</p>
<p>I highly recommend doing some sales courses and even spending a few months or a year working in a sales only environment where you rely on commissions only. Doing something like that for a year will turn almost anyone into a gun salesman.</p>
<p>Any job from telephone sales or cold calling for a year and you will have undertaken an apprenticeship in sales and given you a solid foundation with which to grow your business.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Know When To Quit</h2>
<p>This sounds so negative but I have to say it. There are some stubborn people out there that will spend their lives <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">bumping along the bottom</a> struggling to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">pay their staff</a> and putting more than 3 times as many hours into running their business than if they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">worked as an employee</a> while <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">earning barely enough</a> to feed themselves.</p>
<p>If you get to the 5 year mark and you are not earning at least twice the amount as someone with your experience and qualifications would <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">as an employee</a> then it is time to re-evaluate things. MSP businesses do not sell for huge multiples of their earnings, in many cases it is a one to one sale price.</p>
<p>If you are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">struggling to run the business</a> then it is likely that business requires you to function meaning the actual sale price of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">business is worth even less</a> and in many cases you are selling a customer list only.</p>
<p>Ask yourself at the 5 year mark, is it worth the current effort and worry? Be honest and if it is not, get out. Move on to something that will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">make you a living</a> and is worth the amount of hours you are putting into it.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Some of these may be not what you want to hear but I think there is just way too much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_positivity">toxic positivity</a> for want of a better word out there today.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with a realistic view of the hurdles that you are likely to face as a new service provider but I will say do not let anyone talk you out of it if you believe you have what it takes.</p>
<p>There are way to many <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">successful MSPs</a> out there <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">raking in a fortune</a> telling others who are looking to start their own MSP that they are irresponsible, do not have the right experience or qualifications to do it and really go out of their way to mock those who are at the same place they were 30 years ago.</p>
<p>I guarantee you most of the guys puffing on their cigars telling the newcomers they have no right to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">start an MSP</a> or that there needs to be regulations to prevent people starting their own service provider because they lack the ability to service other businesses, they started in their own bedroom while living with their parents with a single computer and a single client.</p>
<p>If they did not then where else did they come from? A group of guys with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">bunch of cash</a>? How are they any more positioned to determine who can and cannot join the party?</p>
