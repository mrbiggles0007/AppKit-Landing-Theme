<p>Onsite visits by MSPs, if onsite visits are necessary anymore and if so the frequency of site visits will be the fascinating and worthwhile topic of today's article.</p>
<p>There were two choices as far as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">IT consultants</a> back when <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">IT services</a> were just starting to become part of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">corporate makeup</a> in the early 90s and that was you were either an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">internal IT resource</a> that was an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employee of the organization</a> or you worked for an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">early version of an MSP</a> which engaged in a good 90% onsite work.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">Remote management tools</a> apart from perhaps <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp monitoring apps-index-page">RDP</a> did not exist the way they do today. The numbers have now reversed and it would be safe to say that 90% of all work carried out by an MSP is undertaken remotely.</p>
<p>This is because <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp monitoring apps-index-page">remote tools</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/mssps - index">security</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">internet infrastructure</a> has improved so significantly as to make <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">remote technical support</a> as effective as onsite support with the added benefit of it being far <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">more cost effective</a>.</p>
<p>Below, I am going to discuss the primary reasons why MSPs still conduct onsite visits and if these reasons are worth the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">significantly higher cost</a> involved.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="display-6">Onsite MSP Misconception</h2>
<p>The biggest misconception is that MSPs still conduct onsite visits because there are certain types of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">technical tasks</a> that require a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">technical resource</a> to actually be onsite in front of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">equipment</a> and while that can be true, in cases such as if a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">network switch fails</a> and nobody is able to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">access it remotely</a> then an onsite visit will be required.</p>
<p>These incidents though are becoming quite rare and so the reason onsite visits by MSPs are still conducted is more about the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">client perception</a> and ensuring that they feel they are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">getting value for money</a>. It also allows the MSP to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">stay informed</a> on any issues that may occur that would not be picked via <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp monitoring apps-index-page">remote support methods</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Remote MSP Support Only</h2>
<p>The advent of MSPs that provide <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp monitoring apps-index-page">remote only support</a> has increased from almost zero in the early 2000s to now being the most significant type of MSP in the market today.</p>
<p>It is understandable as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting statistics on msp hardware purchasing">cost to troubleshoot problems</a> remotely is significantly less than if you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">need to account</a> for onsite visits and it only takes a couple of onsite visits before the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">cost blows out</a> and it is costing an organization more to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">provide a managed services agreement</a> than they are making from it.</p>
<p>The most common approach to the need for providing onsite assistance is to have access to a number of local <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">IT Techs</a> who can attend the site if required.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Local Versus Multi State Versus Global</h2>
<p>The truth is that a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">multi state</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">global setup</a> for an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">MSP client</a> is not ideal for the majority of business. While I understand that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">large MSPs</a> offering services to multiple states or even globally have no choice but to operate in this fashion and as a result <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">large MSP clients</a> do not really have much of a choice.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">smaller service providers</a> of between 20 and 200 staff restricted or specialized in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">single geographical area</a> such as a city or large town, they are going to provide a much <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">better level of service</a> when it comes to onsite support.</p>
<p>Almost all of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff</a> are going to be local and understand the geographical layout. They tend to be more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">focused on reputation</a> because gaining a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">poor reputation</a> in that one area is going to have a far more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">significant impact</a> than an MSP that has a presence in say 30 states. They can take a hit in one area and it is not going to make much of a difference.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">Locally based MSPs</a> will have more experience with providing onsite visits and there will be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/application purchase and cloud-based subscription fees">less resistance</a> to undertaking them as part of a healthy and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">balanced service agreement</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Onsite Visits Require People Skills</h2>
<p>There certainly seems to be a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">reduction of technical staff</a> in MSPs that have the base level of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">soft skills required</a> to gain the significant benefits regular onsite visits can bring.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">ran my own MSP</a>, there were one or two guys who were <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">technically quite gifted</a> and head and shoulders above everyone else in that area but you had to hide them away in a cupboard if a client was likely to visit and you certainly never contemplated sending them out onsite at a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">clients office</a>.</p>
<p>While years ago they were in the minority, I think the way the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">current market operates</a>, which is nearly all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">remote work</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">technicians</a> over time have lost their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">soft skills</a> and from what I have seen, there are more than ever who struggle with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">human interaction</a>.</p>
<p>Like anything in life, if you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">stop using something</a> then it disappears, from muscles to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">conversational skills</a>. If you are an MSP that avoids like the plague onsite visits because they are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">too expensive</a> then you will be contributing to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">decline of your staff's ability</a> to engage with clients staff face to face.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">lack of communication</a> within your own MSP often starts like a snowball and I have seen this first hand. Onsite visits decline to a point they are optional in which case many <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">eliminate them</a> altogether due to the cost and you think it stops there but it actually gets worse.</p>
<p>An analogy is much like doing no exercise, the less you do, the less you want to do until one day you wake up and find you no longer leave your chair because even slight movement causes fatigue.</p>
<p>Once onsite visits stop, you think staff will still <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">use the phone</a> to make calls but it does not work that way. Soon <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">phone calls stop</a> and every single piece of communication is being conducted through a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">ticket queue</a>. Sure it is efficient and it could be argued that having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">all communication recorded</a> in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">service ticket</a> is a good thing however it does not end there.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">Technicians</a> then begin to only enter half and then a quarter of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">client engagement</a> in the tickets, they forget or think it is pointless to write useful and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">effective notes</a> to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">document the work</a> they have undertaken.</p>
<p>It gets to a point where there is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">so little communication</a> going on between the service provider and the client and between the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">MSP staff</a> to each other that the client begins to wonder what it is we are doing for that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">agreement fee</a> they pay at the start of every month.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">MSP Client Perception</h2>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">Client perception</a> is everything in this game. You may be doing a mother beautiful job and preventing significant amounts of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps are moving to halo psa">client downtime</a> that are a direct result of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">systems and processes</a> you have put in place.</p>
<p>All of that can be true and they will still walk away from your organization for another MSP that you know full well <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising facts about managed backups with managed service providers">hire cheap labor</a> that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">do not know what they are doing</a> and they will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">pay significantly more</a> for them because their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">sales team</a> is better than yours and the worst part is they will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">never admit making the mistake</a> of walking away from you.</p>
<p>An example of how perception is everything is that in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">my own MSP</a>, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">invoices</a> that I sent out that came back with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">most amount of complaints</a> were <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">invoices</a> that were less than 30 minutes long. By attempting to be as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">honest as possible</a> and only bill for our time led to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">client complaints</a> far greater than any other activity we engaged in.</p>
<p>My solution was to always <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">bill time and materials</a> work for a minimum of one hour regardless of how long the work actually took. The result of this was that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">invoice complaints</a> dropped significantly. This is because of the perception that you took hardly any time so why should you bill me for it?</p>
<p>An analogy is that of a junior plumber and an experienced plumber working on an identical job. The junior plumber spends 4 hours trying to fix the problem, having to contact more senior plumbers for advice before finally fixing it by replacing the hot water system.</p>
<p>The senior plumber comes in and kicks the hot water system in a certain spot and fixes the problem within minutes of arriving. The senior plumber fixed the problem fast because he knew where to kick the water system to get it working again and saved the homeowner 4 hours of his time plus the cost of the hot water system. The outcome is far more favorable to the homeowner.</p>
<p>What do you think the homeowners reaction would be if the senior plumber attempted to charge $800 which is exactly half what the junior plumber cost? He would hit the roof and there would be a refusal to pay regardless of the outcome.</p>
<p>Even if the plumber tried charging for an hour's work it would leave the homeowner feeling ripped off and yet the outcome was far more favorable.</p>
<p>It is exactly the same as an MSP. The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">client</a> needs to feel as if they are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">getting value for money</a> and onsite visits rightly or wrongly are one of the indicators the client uses to determine if they are getting that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">value for money</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Conducting onsite visits should only partly be about the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">actual work</a> that needs to be undertaken. MSPs should use it as a tool to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">increase visibility</a> with the client and get a feel for the current sentiment held for your organization.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">onsite support tech</a> should have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">proven soft skills</a> and ability to converse with clients without risking a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">contract ending incident</a> every time they open their mouths. There should also be a rough <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">checklist document</a> of questions the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">visiting technician</a> should be attempting to ask and get answers to.</p>
<p>My view is still that MSPs that are local to the client they are supporting are always going to be a better choice than a multinational organization that has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">no physical presence</a> in your state. The onsite support will always be of a higher order and they will be more likely concerned about their local reputation than an out of state organization.</p>
