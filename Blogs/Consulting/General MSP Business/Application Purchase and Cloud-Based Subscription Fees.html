<p>I will be discussing the upside and downside of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/msp cloud backups for workstations">cloud based subscription</a> services and comparing these offerings against the other option of traditional <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">perpetual license</a> purchases.</p>
<p>We will be giving an overview of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting statistics on msp hardware purchasing">purchasing mechanism</a> rather than the actual function of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">software</a>. These days the option to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">purchase</a> based on a subscription based pricing model is probably the more dominant way <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">software development houses</a> offer their items and it is no secret as to why that is the case. I think everyone can agree that a smaller ongoing commitment definitely benefits the providers.</p>
<p>We will go into the downsides of cloud based subscription fees such as being <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/issues trusting one backup vendor">locked in to a single vendor</a> whereby it can be quite difficult to move your company information away to another provider.</p>

</ul>
<p>I am going to crop dust some <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">MSP documentation</a> magic into this article for several reasons. It is one of the areas I am both proficient in and really enjoy and because <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">MSP documentation strategies</a> seem appropriate no matter what the topic is. Perhaps that is just my bias showing.</p>
<p>I mention it so that I may get the opportunity to give feedback on how we maintain documentation for areas such as&nbsp; <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">info recovery solutions</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">enterprise virtualization</a> as well as how a company documents its <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">acquisition of software</a> regardless as to if they are on a subscription basis or purchased outright.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">technical publication process</a> is&nbsp; an essential aspect of the IT industry whether it be documenting software based assets as discussed here or the steps involved on how to add a new client into your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas/5 tips on backups as a service">Backups as a Service solution</a> so that your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">loyal support desk staff</a> can fault-find in a time effective fashion. It enables <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">IT hardware services</a> to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">clients</a> effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have years of experience in working with service providers to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">document their processes</a> and procedures and there is no area more important to a service provider than how their clients' information including cloud subscription services are documented.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Cloud Subscription Services Origins</h2>
<p>Call me a cynic however I think the main driver for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">software houses</a> to move over to a subscription based model is it is just straight up more profitable for them. Once you sign up and that $87.50 starts being deducted every month from your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">visa card</a>, you are on the hook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was not always that way though, certainly in the 90s and even early 2000s I do not remember ever seeing any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">software company</a> offering subscription based models other than perhaps for updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technically there were <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for msps">cloud services</a> back in the 90s however they were not widely adopted and I had certainly not heard of them at that time. It is funny how the mind works, I swear <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">Dropbox</a> was the first serious attempt at a cloud based subscription model however it was not released until 2008.</p>
<p>The first real significant attempt at a cloud subscription model was by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> in around 2004 when they released the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/should msps backup google workspace">elastic cloud network</a> (EC2) This was Amazons fortress of solitude of which they used as a solid foundation for the many subscription based services they now provide.</p>
<p>Amazon gained a solid foothold into a subscription cloud based offering. Of course <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">Microsoft Azure</a> and the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">O365 ecosystem</a> also rose to the occasion and to provide competition and keep Amazon honest.</p>
<p>2015 is the year where subscription based services started to become dominant over standalone software purchases. While you can still purchase, for example, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">standalone versions of Office</a> (Office 2021) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> tends to go out of their way to where it ends up being the least attractive option.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Upfront Cost Versus Ongoing Indefinite Subscription</h2>
<p>I know there are many out there that like the idea of paying the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">total cost of an application</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Microsoft Office</a> or even a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">backup solution</a>, effectively being able to hold the product in your hand and taking ownership of the application.</p>
<p>The truth is that it is starting to make less sense to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">purchase software</a> this way. Often it is a high upfront cost for an outright purchase versus the relatively low monthly premium of a subscription service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Office 2021</a>, for a business to purchase outright, it is about $450 and while it gives you a lifetime access to updates, the reality is that the software is only ever going to be supported for a finite amount of time.</p>
<p>You might get a good 7 years out of the application and when you share the initial cost out across those 7 years, it is certainly a far cheaper option than the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">Office365 subscription</a> model. More likely though, its life will be far shorter, more like 3 years.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is hinted at in the name. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">MS office 2021</a>, it is already 2 years old and while you will get updates over its lifetime, the features that are continuously added to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/cloud apps-index">O365</a> mean that the subscription based option will always have the latest and greatest features. I can tell you from experience that there is nothing worse than seeing a feature you really need on the subscription model that is not available on the standalone application.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Underhanded Vendor Tactics</h2>
<p>This can happen regardless as to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">purchasing strategy</a> you decide on but I can give a few examples of where I was left high and dry by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">various vendors</a> after having invested heavily in their standalone application offering.</p>
<p>Back in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">mid 2000s</a> and well before brightgauge, I purchased a dashboard system that I think used <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">powershell</a> for my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">Connectwise Manage</a> from a couple of flash guys from Hollywood in Florida. I cannot remember the name of the app now, it may have been called something like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">SmartConnect</a>. I spent from memory a good $3500 back then for the application as well as a year of updates which was quite a lot of money for me in those days.</p>
<p>No sooner had I installed the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">various dashboards</a> to my liking that I got a message advising me that they appreciated my business and that I could continue to use my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/vertical apps-index">locally installed copy</a> of their software and of course the updates I had paid for would continue to run.</p>
<p>So far so good:)</p>
<p>They then went on to advise that once my year of updates was up, there would be no possibility of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">purchasing further updates</a> for the software as they had decided to stop supporting the local instances of their application.</p>
<p>It got worse. They rubbed my nose in this new application they had been working on with all the bells and whistles. It was basically the same application I had paid $3500 for, only it had about 30% more features and of course they were all highly desirable.</p>
<p>On top of that, they worked out a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">nice price</a> of about $350 a month to transition over to their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud app</a>. To say I had been bent over and given a painful rogering would be an understatement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I chose to just use the application I had purchased, the &ldquo;<em>year of updates</em>&rdquo; included ended up being a con as they did not once update the application over that year instead investing their efforts into the subscription based offering.</p>
<p>I used it for a year or so until the lack of updates made it incompatible with the newer versions of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">CW Manage</a>. So that is an example of where you can be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">treated quite unfairly by vendors</a> if you make the decision to make a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">large upfront payment</a> for an application.</p>
<p>I believe several years later even <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">Connectwise</a> started to make it quite difficult to have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">server based copy</a> of their software running locally. The details are murky due to the passing of time however I am pretty sure I paid a large upfront amount and in the end we were forced to adopt the subscription model too.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Which Model Do Vendors Prefer?</h2>
<p>I think it goes without saying, they all got addicted to the subscription model once they realized that consistent, reliable nuggets of cash could be extracted from consumers on a monthly basis indefinitely.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Which Model Do Consumers Prefer?</h2>
<p>This is a bit more difficult to answer however in today's environment, subscription based services have become more sophisticated and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">easier to manage</a>. The days of standalone software products for a vast majority of corporate applications is coming to an end.</p>
<p>Vendors know it is in their best interest to have signups and so they do tend to make the subscription services appear more desirable than their standalone counterparts.</p>
<p>Given the choice, my opinion is that subscription based software services win in all areas from the ease of signing up (sometimes a curse) the lower initial amount required coupled with ongoing updates meaning you know you always have the most up to date version.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Disadvantages Of Subscription Based Applications</h2>
<p>The first disadvantage is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">amount you pay</a> in a subscription service is often inconsequential and at a level where you do not give signing up a second thought &ldquo;<em>what is $30 if it solves a problem, what is another $130 to solve another problem</em>&rdquo; and on and on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compare this to what is often a significant overhead when you buy a perpetual license. The amount gives you reason to pause and ask &ldquo;<em>Do we really need this?</em>&rdquo; You tend to scrutinize it far more even though it may be a far more cost effective option than a subscription service over its life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My second thought is also both a blessing and a curse and that is ease of signup. Vendors have signups down to a fine art. Most integrate with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">existing authentication systems</a> and so you do not even need to put a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">password</a> in, 3 clicks and a drop down box and you are done.</p>
<p>Why is that a disadvantage? Ever notice you tend to collect subscriptions to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp documentation apps overview">MSP applications</a> coming out of your credit card? $40 here, $150 there and before you know it you are noticing a hefty <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">wad of cash</a> leaving your account and are never entirely sure which of them is important and which is not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often the job to go through and cancel subscriptions you do not need can be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">time consuming</a> and so it gets put off. The end result is your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">outgoings</a> are higher than they should be and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">Kaseya execs</a> are getting fat off of extended steak lunches courtesy of you.</p>
<p>The ease of which you can sign up is why this accumulation of subscriptions happens. One piece of advice here is to set up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">virtual credit cards</a>, one for each vendor, that way it segregates everything and makes it a little easier to manage and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">cancel non required services</a>. It also prevents cretins from charging your account for services you did not approve.</p>
<p>Other disadvantages of subscription based payment models are that you need to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">relinquish some control</a> and are at the mercy of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">cloud application vendor</a>. If they are not solid then there is a possibility they could go zero dark thirty with your organization's information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned, getting your information out of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor's ecosystem</a> can sometimes be far more difficult than it needs to be. Lets face it, the vendor has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">no incentive</a> to make this process easy or painless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of this are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">ITGlue</a> where all you get is a flat CSV file of all your company information if you decide to move over to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Hudu</a> or another <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">documentation platform</a>. This means the years of invested time that went into relating items together will be lost and need to be re done.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Advantages of Subscription Based Cloud Apps</h2>
<p>The primary benefits for going subscription over <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">purchasing apps outright</a> is the lower upfront cost and a lower barrier to entry. Subscription based apps these days are generally very convenient to sign up to and will include a trial period without handing over <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">credit card details</a>.</p>
<p>The good ones also allow you to cancel anytime so if your circumstances change then you can end the relationship that is a maximum of the billing cycle (usually monthly)</p>
<p>Ongoing and continuous updates to the product you are paying for is also a great feature to have as well as the fact these changes are usually very minor compared to the sudden shock of having to upgrade to a new version of the same software such as going from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Windows 10 to Windows 11</a>. It is enough of a change that you will require time to get used to the new version.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Advantages Of Perpetual License</h2>
<p>The biggest advantage is that it is yours meaning you often have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">greater control</a> of it than a subscription license although much of that is probably just perception.</p>
<p>The cost over the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">life of the application</a> is nearly always less than with the equivalent subscription model. There may also be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">tax advantages</a> that come with paying an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">upfront cost</a> for an application rather than ongoing lower payments over many years.</p>
<p>Finally, you do not rely on a vendor to remain in business to use your licensed product, it is yours. If they go out of business one day then most likely you can continue to run the application without any noticeable effects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compare that to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for managed service providers">cloud vendor</a> who will disappear with your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01">company information</a>, your clients information and a wake of confusion and wasted time figuring out why your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud app</a> is not working.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Depending on the relevant application, you may not have much of a choice these days when it comes to choosing which strategy you want to use to pay for your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">business applications</a>.</p>
<p>My view is that the tide has now turned and there are far more advantages in choosing the subscription model over an outright perpetual license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions, while it is appropriate in most circumstances to use a subscription service for example, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas/backups as a service">online MSP backup solutions</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Office productivity suites</a> and even <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">network hardware</a>, there are still some software categories that can still be purchased in its perpetual form.</p>
<p>An example is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/operating systems-index">OEM version</a> of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Windows 11 operating system</a> as well as Office 2021 however I am pretty sure they have started to roll out at least an option to obtain <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">Windows 11</a> as a subscription. I suspect that given another couple of years there will be no software that will use the perpetual licensing method other than perhaps the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/operating systems-index">OEM version</a> of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">operating systems</a> that come with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Hardware/TOP LEVEL PAGES/Workstations">pre-built machines</a> from the likes of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">Dell or HP</a>.&nbsp;</p>
