<p>Backup applications, their success and failures during significant <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/choosing an msp backup solution">disaster recovery incidents</a> will be the uplifting discussion of today's article.</p>
<p>Try as I might and I have, there is nowhere that universally reports which backup application was involved in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/best effort and msp liability">serious disaster incident</a> or breaks it down into a successful or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">failed disaster recovery</a> attempt.</p>
<p>Not going to lie, that blows my mind. It means as service providers, we have to spend hours of our time trawling through forums looking for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">anecdotal evidence</a> attempting to select a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup vendors/axcient versus redstor for msp client backups">backup solution</a> that fails the least and hoping that the posts are not out of date or skewed in some way.</p>
<p>What I will do though is do that research and document below what I have found out. I will also attempt to put together a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">basic evaluation checklist</a> that could or should be used to evaluate the performance of backup applications that have been involved in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client refuses recommended backup solution">disaster recovery incidents</a>.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Backup Solutions To Avoid</h2>
<p>After having undertaken quite a bit of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">research</a> on this I have come to the conclusion that there are currently two backup solutions that should actively be avoided. The first is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">Kaseya Spanning Backup Solution</a> which I thought needed its <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">very own article here</a>.</p>
<p>The second is an old favorite of mine which has since been purchased by <a href="https://www.arcserve.com/">Arcserve</a> and seems to have had a big fall from grace since that point in time. It is such a shame because I associate this product with a bit of nostalgia. I have added some of the many links on the problems people are experiencing with Shadow Protect/Storagecraft below:</p>

<h2 class="display-6">How Often Do Disaster Recovery Attempts Fail?</h2>
<p>According to multiple sources, they fail from between 36% and 58% of the time where the rubber meets the road. Let's take the middle ground here and go with about 50% of the time. This means that 50% of the time when you get that dreaded <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">call from the client</a> that means your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup strategies/choosing an msp backup solution">disaster recovery plan</a> needs to be put into action, 50% of the time, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/backup appliance vs network attached storage">recovery evolution</a> is going to fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that does not necessarily mean <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">complete failure</a>. If you are like me, your head is sometimes <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">back in the 90s</a> where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/list of high profile backup failures by msps">backup failures</a> were measured like a light switch, on or off, yes or no. Today backup failures need to be measured in time as well as a number of other metrics.</p>
<p>If it takes 7 days to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/build your own nas with truenas">recover a backup</a> and that backup is restored perfectly when the client needed their data restored in 24 hours then it should be classed as a failure even if that is what they initially agreed to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this article is not really interested in the majority of ways a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup can fail</a> which is nearly always down to either a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">misconfiguration</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">lack of training or expertise</a> among many others. We are only really interested in how often named backup applications <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">fail to recover data</a> in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">disaster recovery scenario</a> due to an application failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason for this is because it is one of the few instances where we only have one chance to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">avoid this level of pain</a> before passing that point where it is out of our hands.</p>
<p>That point is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor selection phase</a> just before we hand over our <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">credit card</a>. That is the only point where we have the ability to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">avoid backup vendors</a> whose products do not deliver and are basically ticking time bombs sitting on a shelf.</p>
<p>While we are only interested in the backup application based failure, for us to make sense of it all, we still need to know the other areas that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">backups often fail</a> and separate them into their own groups.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Types Of Backup Failure</h2>
<p>Not all scenarios when a backup application fails to restore during a disaster recovery scenario can be attributed to the backup application being used. There are times where the reason the disaster recovery attempt failed was due to things like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">insufficient training</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">improper use</a> of the backup application.</p>
<p>If I was tasked with coming up with an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">evaluation sheet</a> that could be used to universally measure the success and failure of a backup application in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liability waiver when client declines msp backup recommendation">disaster recovery incident</a> then these are the areas I would like to see measured and segmented as this would give service providers some <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">valuable information</a> via an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">independent impartial body</a> that will assist in selecting what is often a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">very expensive</a> and vital component of our <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">service provider stack</a>.</p>
<p>I would also separate the options into three, where either the backup application is at fault, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">service provider</a> is at fault or a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">third party is at fault</a> because it would be unfair to assign <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">lack of training</a> or misconfiguration or a failure of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/is cloud storage a viable alternative to nas storage">storage provider</a> to the backup application vendor. I am a strong believer in taking personal responsibility for areas under your control and if a service provider fails to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">train staff</a> to a level where they can effectively and correctly <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup applications overview">configure a backup solution</a> then that is on them.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Backup Application Failure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Failed update introducing product failure</li>
<li>Falsely indicating a successful backup&nbsp;</li>
<li>Inadequate alerting when a failure occurs</li>
<li>Known issue ignored</li>
<li>Known compatibility issues</li>
<li>Poorly designed not fit for purpose</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="display-4">Managed Service Provider Failure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alerting incorrectly setup</li>
<li>Alerting not monitored by anyone</li>
<li>Mismatched config to client needs</li>
<li>Poorly chosen product for the job it is used for</li>
<li>Poor training of staff</li>
<li>Misunderstandings</li>
<li>Zero Disaster Recovery Testing</li>
<li>Ransomware Incidents</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="display-4">Third Party Failure</h3>
<ul>
<li>ISP Failure</li>
<li>3rd party storage failure</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="display-6">Assigning Blame When Disaster Recovery Fails</h2>
<p>It is not all that easy surprisingly to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">assign blame</a> when there is a failure caused by a backup application. I am sure most of you hold <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">service level agreements</a> with your clients where you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">make promises</a> based on rectifying an issue within a certain time frame.</p>
<p>Picture this, you start getting alerts the backup is failing and you miss a round of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client backup verification process">scheduled backups</a> over a 24 hour period. You do the right thing and inform clients that it is out of your hands as you find out the problem is due to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">configuration error</a> made by the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">backup application vendor</a>.</p>
<p>All good? What happens at the tail end of that if your client suddenly has a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">catastrophic failure</a> and requires your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">disaster recovery plan</a> to be implemented. Number one issue here is that for the past 24 hours you have not been backing up their information as stated in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">SLA</a> and even though they have been advised, it still means you are failing to meet your agreed upon <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">SLA</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the problem with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-vendors-index">backup vendor</a> is bad enough there may be issues where you are unable to access or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liability waiver when client declines msp backup recommendation">recover backups</a> you know you have while the application vendor goes about fixing whatever problem caused the backups to fail in the first place.</p>
<p>It does not matter that these events are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">completely out of your control</a>, all that matters is that you have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">signed contract</a> with clients promising to deliver a level of service that you are currently unable to meet.</p>
<p>It gets even worse if say the backup application <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">vendor has caused a problem</a> that has gone unnoticed for an extended period of time and it is found out you have not been backing up for several weeks even if all of the checks are coming up green.</p>
<p>The only thing that can get you out of a situation like this is a good quality <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">cyber insurance policy</a> because someone is going to have to pay in this situation, it is probably not going to be the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">backup vendor</a> especially if they are large because they usually have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">bullet proof disclaimers</a> along with the fact it is not in the best interest of the very fabric of how business interoperates to open a large business up to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">company ending lawsuits</a> everytime the service they are providing causes downtime for their clients (you)</p>
<p>The courts will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">limit the potential damage</a> they can face. Put another way, imagine if <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> was <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">held accountable</a> everytime they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">caused damage</a> to their customers because of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">outages or security incidents</a> or because the application they provide has been found to have an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security vulnerability overview">inherent security flaw</a>? They would have been <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">sued out of existence</a> years ago and unfortunately for the smaller guys down the trough that means we are the ones that end up being <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">held accountable</a> for the losses often for events out of our control.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Blaming Backup App For Failure Is Almost Impossible</h2>
<p>In researching this article, I initially thought it would be quite easy to find the answers to the question regarding which backup application on the market has the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">highest level of failure</a> as well as find out which backup app has the least amount of failures over time.</p>
<p>I am specifically talking about times where the service provider using the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">back up solution</a> had no possible way of either knowing the failure was going to occur and the fault that caused it was specifically due to the backup application itself.</p>
<p>What I have found is that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">accountability for the failure</a> always leads back to the service provider. Say the application had an update that caused it to fail due to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">VSS issue</a> with one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">version of Windows Server</a> with a particular update that just so happened to affect 8 servers you backup. On Top of that, the application was applying a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/monitoring backups for non agreement clients">successful backup alert</a> to a failed backup.</p>
<p>Pretty clear cut that this issue was caused by a problem the backup app vendor introduced and therefore they should be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">held accountable</a> right? You would be wrong. This is for a number of reasons. As the provider you could have provided a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">secondary backup solution</a> such as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">local backup copy</a> using a different backup application.</p>
<p>You could have set up an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/baas/backups as a service">automated restore testing environment</a> that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/virtual machine">mounts the backup images</a> and a range of other safeguards.</p>
<p>Ultimately many people mistake the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">legal system</a> for a process that is in some way fair. People get <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">successfully sued</a> every day over events they had no control over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is why it is very important to have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">cyber security policy</a> that provides good coverage for events such as backup failure or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">ransomware incidents</a>, because you cannot possibly foresee every area where you may be held accountable when things go wrong.</p>
<p>I would go one step further and also advise that every single one of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">your clients</a> should have their own <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">cyber security insurance policy</a>. With so much risk in the MSP space these days it is not uncommon to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">refused coverage outright</a> however you can not only substantially <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">reduce your policy cost</a>, you also decrease the chances of being <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/is billing clients to test backups normal">refused coverage</a> with this strategy along with ultimately helping protect you and your clients interests.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Backup application failure where the failure is both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client refuses recommended backup solution">catastrophic</a> as well going unnoticed due to the application <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">falsely reporting</a> successful backups when they are in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">failed state</a> are actually quite rare especially if you both research the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup vendors overview">backup vendor</a> and go with one of the well known companies.</p>
<p>From what I could find, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/msp backups - client expectations">disaster recovery failures</a> are almost always caused by misconfiguration or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">negligent conduct</a> by the service provider. Less than 1% of all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/msp backups - client expectations">disaster recovery failures</a> were caused by the backup application faults where the service provider was not aware and even if they were, could not have rectified the issue.</p>
<p>In other words, it is a non issue and even then, it is such a complex path to navigate that if it does occur, leaning on your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/liabilities of hosting client backups">cyber-insurance policy</a> is the wisest decision you can make rather than attempting to argue your case on the basis of fairness.</p>
<p>If life was fair not a single organism could exist. Ultimately nobody cares about fairness except for those unfairly treated and the outcome is almost always going to give you more pain because the outcome is going to almost always be unfair in some way. That is why we have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">technology insurance</a>. Let the insurance fight the issue and concentrate on what you are good at, which is running your business.</p>
