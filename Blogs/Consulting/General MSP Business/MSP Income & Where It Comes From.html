<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">Managed service provider income</a> and where it comes from will be the riveting subject of today's article and who knows, it may even come as a surprise to some. I must admit I was quite surprised at the diversity and variation of how this changes from one service provider to another.</p>
<p>During the turn of the century, the primary method of extracting a living from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">running an IT business</a> was to wait until something stopped working at which point someone called you and you would jump in the car and visit the person in need or often they would bring their computer into your workshop.</p>

<li><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">Why You Should Avoid Internal Documentation Management</a></li>
</ul>
<p>During the early 2000s someone had a moment of clarity and said to themselves &ldquo;<em>Instead of </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing"><em>waiting for things to break</em></a><em>, how about we charge a relatively </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index"><em>modest fee</em></a><em> each month and work towards preventing things breaking in the first place</em>&rdquo; And the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">modern MSP</a> was born.</p>
<p>While most service providers will offer some form of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">break fix</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">adhoc service</a> as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">project work</a>, it is usually a fraction of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">income created</a> from other areas.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Why Is Break Fix Not More Popular?</h2>
<p>This is purely anecdotal and from direct experience. Lets face it, if a client only ever engages with their IT service provider in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">break fix arrangement</a> then either they are very small or they are going to be an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">awful client</a> that you do not want to be anywhere near.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because break fix is always going to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">significantly more expensive</a> to the client over a given time frame so the inexperienced will be scratching their heads and saying &ldquo;<em>Well that is a good thing, you will make way more money for the same work</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately it does not work that way. What will happen is that there will be a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">psychological attack</a> pretty much considered a form of warfare from the client where they will attempt to condition you into agreeing that large amounts of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">work on their systems</a> should either be free or are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">your fault</a> and should also be free.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">Potential clients</a> that demand to be billed only when they have a problem simply do not comprehend the value your organization will bring to them. They will minimize at every turn your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">effort, ability and judgment</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">not pay their invoices</a> until you contact them and then they will spend hours arguing over every single minute you have charged. My advice is to never under any circumstances entertain the idea of doing business with a company that demands <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">time and materials only</a>.</p>
<p>The only time I would make a small exception here is if the client is prepared to pay for say a minimum 50 hour <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">block of time in advance</a>. This means you do not begin doing any work for them until that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">money is in the bank</a> and you make sure you send a new invoice at the 10 hour remaining mark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also strongly advise to never be the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">party that is owed</a> in this arrangement. In my experience these arrangements rarely last to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">second block</a> because the cost of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">maintaining a network</a> with which you have not undergone a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">basic client onboarding process</a> is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">horrendously expensive</a> because even the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">easiest job</a> will take large chunks of time to complete.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Service Agreement And Project Work</h2>
<p>So at the very <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">highest level of MSP income</a> and where it comes from is generally broken into several broad categories and that is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">managed service agreements</a> which is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">maintenance undertaken</a> for clients and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">billed in advance</a> each month. The other is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">project work</a> which involves work undertaken for a client who has a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">specific task</a> they need completed. Then there is the small amount of time and materials work we do for our <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">agreement based clients</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Project Work</h3>
<p>In my experience, project work tends to fluctuate between about 20-30% of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">total paid work</a> undertaken in any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">one financial year</a>. It can be quite enticing to go after project work from non managed service clients however I would strongly advise against this especially if you have had <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">no working relationship</a> with the client.</p>
<p>I understand that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising facts about managed service providers">government tenders</a> and things of that nature are different, however I have found that agreeing to take on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">decent sized projects</a> (anything over 100 hours) with a company that you have no history with and have no knowledge of is about the riskiest move you can make.</p>
<p>Even with an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps are moving to halo psa">upfront payment</a> for say the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">project hardware</a>, you are still behind the 8 ball the moment <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">man hours</a> start being applied to that project so it is not a solution to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/best effort and msp liability">significant risk</a> at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you absolutely think this new client is such a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">great opportunity</a> then at least request the cost of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/workstations index">hardware</a> along with 50% of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">labor cost</a> as an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">up front payment</a> before <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Hardware/TOP LEVEL PAGES/Workstations">computer hardware</a> is ordered or a ticket gets created.</p>
<p>My own strategy with IT project work was to only ever undertake projects for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">existing clients</a> so a prerequisite was to already be an agreement client. It means that you already know the client both at a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top 36 applications and solutions for automotive">technical</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">personal level</a> and are much better positioned to plan for the project's success.</p>
<p>It also avoids that slightly unpleasant situation where you have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">long term loyal agreement</a> based clients that you are ignoring because this angry wildebeest of a blowin who is not an agreement client is jumping up and down demanding all of your attention.</p>
<p>The attention is something you have to give because the thought that you have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">not yet been paid</a> keeps hanging over your head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project client has all the power and your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">loyal agreement clients</a> are treated like second class citizens while you try and get paid. This is not a good long term plan for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">client retention</a> that is for sure.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Time And Materials</h3>
<p>Even though I spoke about this above, I need to mention it here because it still tends to make up between 10-15% of most service providers and realistically, it always will.</p>
<p>The reason is because your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-client-index">agreement clients</a> are always going to need work done outside of the existing agreement. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer screens">New computers installed</a>, new <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/wireless hardware">wireless access points</a> or a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rackmount computers">new computer cabinet installed</a>. These among many other common tasks all fall outside of an agreement and that work is considered either ad hoc or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">time and materials</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">When I ran my MSP</a>, I would work into any service agreement to include a 20 hour <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">block of time</a> paid in advance for these sorts of jobs. Some clients are great with this arrangement and others will prefer to just be invoiced separately for each job undertaken outside of the agreement.</p>
<p>That is OK and I would say half of my clients went that way instead of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">block agreement</a> however I would run into problems if the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">client was poor at paying</a> or liked to argue over every cent.</p>
<p>I tried and pretty much succeeded in filtering out the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">penny pinchers</a> over the years. One of those filtering techniques was the level of pain they put me through when it came to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">paying invoices</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">paying them on time</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would prefer to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/Consulting-Services">lose a client</a> with my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising facts about managed backups with managed service providers">rigid payment terms</a> rather than put up with them complaining over things that they really did not even understand what they were complaining about.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Service Agreement Work</h3>
<p>This is where the bulk of most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">modern service providers</a> make their money. I legitimately believe that charging a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">monthly service fee</a> or agreement and coming to agreement as to what is included is best for both the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client</a> and service provider.</p>
<p>There is a polarization of service providers that tends to really separate professional and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">well funded MSPs</a> with those that have to promise more than they can deliver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having worked with at least 15 MSPs over the last 10 years and being tasked with increasing the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">performance of the documentation</a> and systems being used, the difference between an organization that has invested substantial time into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">processes and procedures</a> is significant.</p>
<p>The main issue with MSPs that have not invested in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">process and procedures</a> is that they cannot <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">scale up or down</a> in any area. They also never seem to improve over time when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">repeatable tasks</a>. The task that took an hour 3 years ago, still takes an hour.</p>
<p>Almost every area of technology can be packaged in agreement form, even <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">computer and network hardware</a>. It works so well because as MSPs, we have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">set known income</a> making it easier to plan and maintain a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">clients infrastructure</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Service Agreement Achilles Heel</h2>
<p>The largest problem when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">engaging a client</a> with a managed services agreement is that it is very difficult from the clients perspective to evaluate if they are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">getting value</a> from the agreement or if they are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising facts about managed backups with managed service providers">paying too much</a>.</p>
<p>The first issue is they are not <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">technical people</a> normally and so there has to be a significant level of faith that the service provider is doing the right thing.</p>
<p>What I have found is that clients tend to mistake <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">value with effort</a>. Often a service provider will legitimately provide far more value when the level of effort appears to be the lowest. What I mean by that is if a service provider has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">excellent technical documentation standards</a> that are regularly updated meaning they do the same thing the same way every time or they have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/the benefits of using chatgpt for creating user manuals and guides for managed services">good support guides</a> then it means less effort is required.</p>
<p>Suddenly <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff</a> are not <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">ringing the support desk</a> as often and the times they do, it takes less time to rectify the issue. This leads to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">clients asking</a> that difficult question - What are we paying you for?</p>
<p>I do not pretend to know how to approach that question because I have faced it a number of times and the results of how I handled it were quite hit and miss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes showing clients <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">dozens of reports</a> showing how your existence actually reduces their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">staff's downtime</a> will not persuade them that they are being diddled in some way.</p>
<p>You have to let those clients go. It is absolutely true that if a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">client is paying you</a> for a service and all else being equal, I would get far more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">billing disputes</a> for a 15 minute <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">invoice</a> than I would for a 2 hour invoice even if the job was identical.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While there will always be some <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">residual work</a> of around 10-15% that is time and materials, and 30% project work, the percentages do not increase beyond that leaving over 50% of most service providers work coming from managed service agreements.</p>
<p>It is also reasonably rare that service providers will undertake <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup clients overview">one off projects</a> or time and materials work for clients that are not already managed service clients as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/best effort and msp liability">risk of significant loss</a> is higher due to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">lack of history</a> with the potential client.</p>
<p>So in that sense it could be argued that nearly 100% of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">income from managed service providers </a>is sourced from managed service agreements.</p>
