<p>Unmasking 5 important documentation tips for small and medium business will be the discussion of today's topic. These 5 tips, if followed, will ensure that you resolve the vast majority of your organization's <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">documentation struggles</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless as to if you use a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation platform</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Hudu, ITGlue</a> or MS Sharepoint, it is not so much the tools you use to manage your MSP documentation, the methods and documentation strategy that you use is actually far more important.</p>
<p>The 5 most important strategic actions for the best tech documentation outcome is what I will outline today.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="display-6">Consistency</h2>
<p>I am putting this as the number one item on the list, without <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">documentation consistency</a>, you may as well not waste your time any further. Grab yourself some water based paint and while dribbling, throw it at your most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/physical servers index">expensive print server</a> because that behavior will give you the same outcome without the ingredient of consistency.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">I have helped</a> at least 20 service organizations over the last 10 years to overhaul their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">documentation systems</a> to a point where they are helping rather than hindering. If you do nothing else to improve the way you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">document your processes</a>, then consistency alone will help you move further than any other single strategy.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">Consistency of documentation</a> includes ensuring that the way you deliver it to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">technical support desk employees</a> is the same every single time. From <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">folder structure of file systems</a> to the font that gets used and the way in which you separate paragraphs or the way you use bullet points.</p>
<p>Consistency for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">end consumer</a> of your documentation fosters trust amongst your staff and without it you will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">breed employee distrust</a> amongst your staff and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">client staff</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Framework</h2>
<p>I strongly advocate for buying off the shelf documentation tools such as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Hudu documentation management system</a>. You need to decide what you are, are you the guy hammering nails or are you the guy making the hammers? You cannot do both with any level of competence.</p>
<p>Sure that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">Access database</a> you built back in 1997 has done a good job, but the truth is when compared to current <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">industry leading documentation platforms</a>, it is junk. Roll your own documentation platforms using a combination of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">OneNote and Sharepoint</a> need to be eliminated if you want to remain competitive in todayâ€™s market.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Training</h2>
<p>It amazes me the amount of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">experienced business leaders</a> that believe that they can just buy something like <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">IT Glue</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Hudu</a> off the shelf and expect their staff to either just start using it or even know how to build an effective foundation.</p>
<p>They are shocked when having invested in these documentation platforms that their investment is not showing an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">immediate financial return</a>. I am afraid to say that a return on investment is not possible without a significant <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">investment in training</a>.</p>
<p>You should also be seeking out organizations that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/">specialize in implementing documentation platforms</a> and who have seen what works, what does not work and repeated it dozens of times in the past.</p>
<p>Regardless as to if your solution is self built off the shelf, a significant effort needs to be made to ensure that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">future staff members</a> can be brought on board with as little effort as possible and that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">ex staff members</a> are not walking away with significant amounts of knowledge.</p>
<p>Ongoing training is the only real way to ensure that your organization becomes scalable in both directions. It makes the process of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">onboarding new staff members</a> as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">offboarding ex clients</a> or staff members a breeze.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Stick With A Plan</h2>
<p>Always stick with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">documentation maintenance plan</a> once you have committed to a strategy.</p>
<p>I often see service providers being driven by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">staff movements</a>. So the person who had perhaps implemented a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">documentation strategy</a> and successfully ensured all other staff followed the processes suddenly leaves and their replacement decides it would be a good time to put his own stamp on things and within 3 months radically changes the documentation process before deciding it is not for him and moves on within 6 months leaving half of their changes incomplete.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat a few times and suddenly you have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">documentation disaster</a> on your hands. This has knock on effects where it makes it hard to get work completed so tech staff develop low morale and suddenly the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">churning of staff</a> becomes a very real problem.</p>
<p>This is like a snowball where staff stay less time meaning nobody stays around long enough to fix the problem that is causing employees to leave.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Outsourcing Documentation Tasks</h2>
<p>I strongly advocate for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">separating the documentation framework</a> and ongoing documentation tasks from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">internal employee duties</a> for several reasons.</p>
<p>The biggest reason is that most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">technical staff</a> do not enjoy completing documentation to the standard needed to make it effective.</p>
<p>There is more often than not plenty of internal petty disagreements whereby the most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">senior employee</a> will win any particular discussion on how to proceed and that is often not the best decision when it comes to creating a more effective documentation platform or for the profitability of the company.</p>
<p>External organizations that specialize in documentation management are experts at getting the most out of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">documentation suite of tools</a> you are using, are not impacted by internal staff politics and have seen whatever problem you are facing often several times before and solved it.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">Internal staff</a> tend to move on more often than a service provider and they have less scrutiny put on them for what is often considered an ancillary task, something to be done if they get time and when it does get done, no two technicians will ever complete a document to the same standard as the other.</p>
<p>It has been my experience that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">outsourcing documentation management</a> causes a huge improvement in documentation effectiveness over a much longer time frame than managing documentation internally has.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The way companies manage the way they distribute information from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">password management</a>, flexible assets, configurations to training documentation is the last remaining area where competitive advantage is magnified and simultaneously is an area many service providers still do not take seriously.</p>
<p>Improving information management even by a small margin will see you improve efficiency across your whole organization as well as make it more likely that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">your clients</a> will stick around for longer than they otherwise would.</p>
