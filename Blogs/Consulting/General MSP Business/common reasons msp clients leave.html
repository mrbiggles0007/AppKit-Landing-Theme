<p>Common reasons clients of MSPs leave is the topic of today&rsquo;s topic. I want to talk about the common misconceptions that tend to be repeated by service providers and if it is possible to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">reverse the damage</a> once it has been done as well as discuss whether you want to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">keep the client</a> even if you could.</p>
<p>The best way of determining why clients leave their previous service provider is to ask <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">new MSP clients</a> why they chose the expensive and time consuming path of leaving. The reasons given will all be the same and will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">allude to incompetence</a>. How and who you ask these questions will allow you to see through to the real reason why they decided to move on.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="display-6">New Clients And Old MSPs</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">20 plus years of working</a> in and around service providers, I have yet to come across a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">new client</a> who was not in some way critical of the previous service provider's ability to undertake the work required.</p>
<p>It has always confounded me because most MSP clients do not possess the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">knowledge or ability</a> to critique <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">what makes an MSP proficient</a> as far as the technical side of things go. That is most often the exact reason they are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">hiring an MSP</a>.</p>
<p>Something that is even crazier, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">incoming MSP</a> always believes the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">new clients perspective</a>, hook line and sinker every time &ldquo;<em>Look at how these clowns have not even </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client expectations on enterprise backup solutions"><em>setup a proper backup</em></a><em> for this client, they should be locked up the incompetent halfwits</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The client gets a chubby over you confirming their significant and costly decision of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">moving service providers</a> was a good one and you as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">incoming MSP</a> gets to feel the romance of being desired and wanted for your no doubt unsurpassed combination of talent, experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever seen a client onboarding go any other way?</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Avoiding The Important Questions</h2>
<p>I am sure the more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">sophisticated providers</a> out there tend to have a screening process to avoid <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">onboarding clients</a> that will cost you rather than <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">save you money</a> and there are plenty out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">Less experienced MSPs</a>, you need to pay attention to this. There are a small yet significant number of companies who always look for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">weak and inexperienced MSPs</a> that they can use and abuse for 12 to 18 months before they do a rinse and repeat cycle often <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">owing significant sums</a> of money.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">Take them to court</a> you say? Enjoy that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">countersuit</a> for 10 times what they owed in unpaid invoices. Sure if you actually go to court and fight it their counterclaim will fall apart but that takes time, effort and most of all, lots of money which they know you do not have being a new business.</p>
<p>They are on the lookout for MSPs that are relatively new and are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">desperate for new business</a>. Anyone who has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">started an MSP from scratch</a> knows how difficult those first few years are prior to reaching the critical mass required to attract interest without much direct effort.</p>
<p>Other companies know that you will pretty much say yes to anything at this point. By understanding this motivation we can see one of the reasons a small yet significant number of clients will leave.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this is not a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client refuses recommended backup solution">huge risk</a> for more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">mature MSPs</a> for two reasons, one, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">experienced MSP</a> will have a selection criteria and checklist for who they take on as clients and second, these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">unscrupulous organizations</a> know that larger older MSPs have the funds to defend as well as attack and so avoid them.</p>
<p>Think of how any predator stalks its prey, they always go after the small and the weak. Business is no different.</p>
<p>The most important question you need to ask is &ldquo;<em>Why did you leave your last MSP?</em>&rdquo; It is not so much asking that question but asking the right people that question to get a feel for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">real reason they left</a>.</p>
<p>Discrete questions to the staff at the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">audit phase</a> of the onboarding before an agreement has been signed is a great place to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">obtain intelligence</a> as to if the prospective client is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">good candidate</a> for your organization.</p>
<p>Attempting to obtain <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">reasons for the split</a> with both executives and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">technical support</a> of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">previous MSP</a> is a gold mine of information if you can crack that nut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, these guys are in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">same industry</a> as you, they live a life and experience and have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">same difficulties</a> as your company does, if you can get on their side and allow them to see that you are not just an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">adversary</a> then not only does it make the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">client onboarding</a> so much easier, you may uncover information that forces you to reconsider taking on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">potential new client</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">MSP Clients Rarely Leave Due To Technical Reasons</h2>
<p>I guarantee that almost every new client will allude to the previous service provider as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/list of high profile backup failures by msps">incompetent</a> in some way. You will rarely get <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">specific events</a> that demonstrate this incompetence and one of the questions you really need to ask when <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">onboarding a new client</a> is for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">specific technical events</a> that caused the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">relationship to fracture</a>.</p>
<p>I mean what is the point of taking on a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">new client</a> if you uncover the fact that they have unfairly and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">unreasonably behaved</a> towards the last MSP? Take away the warm glow of gaining a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">profitable new client</a> for a second and spend some time <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top 36 applications and solutions for automotive">analyzing</a> things critically because it is better to have no client than to have an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">unreasonable client</a> who costs you more than they bring in.</p>
<p>Unless you can pinpoint ongoing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">specific instances</a> of technical and or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising facts about managed backups with managed service providers">service related incompetence</a> then you have to assume that the last MSP was <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">doing their job correctly</a> and there was some other motivation for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">client terminating the agreement</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Predatory MSP Client Behavior</h2>
<p>We need to check this off the list and ensure the reason your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">prospective new client</a> did not leave their old MSP was because they are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">predatory business</a> who loves up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">new service providers</a> every 18 months often leaving <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">massive debts</a> they know full well the MSP does not have the funds to chase.</p>
<p>There are tools that allow you to look up a prospective client's financial and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">legal history</a> at least here in the United States. They cost money however are worth every cent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a mismatch in the obvious maturity of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">prospective client</a> as in they have been around many years however their history only goes back a year or two then that is a huge red flag.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">Bad companies</a> often change their name and company structure every few years so it makes it harder to track their misdeeds. My recommendation is do not take a client who has a mismatch between their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">actual history</a> and their official history.</p>
<p>Of course there are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising facts about managed backups with managed service providers">valid reasons</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation">merging</a> or being bought out however the client should not be hesitant to give you the full details of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">corporate history</a> including when they were operating as a different entity.</p>
<p>Many do not try and hide their past and so if you find the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">potential new MSP client</a> is in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">court</a> more often than they are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps are moving to halo psa">running their business</a> and those court records are for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">non payment of invoices</a> and or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">countersuits</a> for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">technical incompetence</a> then you need to hire an ex olympic sprinter to help you run from this <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">potential client</a> because they absolutely intend to assault you financially.</p>
<p>In summary, when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">predatory MSP clients</a>, intelligence is key as well as to push down that desire as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">growing business</a>, to take on every client that says yes. Over the long term the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">MSPs that are selective</a> in who they bring on as clients are far and above the most successful.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Familiarity Breeds Contempt Amongst MSP Clients</h2>
<p>This is the second and more benign of the reasons MSP clients leave. In any relationship both in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">professional</a> and personal life, the longer you are in it the more chance there is that you start to feel contempt for the other person.</p>
<p>Ever notice the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp ai adoption that artificial intelligence delivered">automatic respect</a> you tend to give someone in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">professional setting</a> and yet the longer you know them and the more you know about them, the less you tend to think of them.</p>
<p>The fact is and with very few exceptions that the longer you know a person or organization the more time you have to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">find the faults</a> that you do not like in a person or organization. This outlook that we all tend to engage in is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">cumulative function</a> over a long time period.</p>
<p>Ever notice when you engage in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">new business relationship</a>, it is all perfect, everyone loves the other party? Do you ever wonder why you give your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">trust and respect</a> so freely to an entity you have just met while another entity that you may have years or even decades of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">shared experience</a> with is looked at with contempt?</p>
<p>This tends to originate from the client as they begin to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">take for granted</a> the work that an MSP does for them. The harder the MSP works, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/application purchase and cloud-based subscription fees">higher the expectation</a>. Humans tend to adapt to whatever environment they are in so you could be doing a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">perfect job</a> of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">maintaining the client's environment</a> and so the client adapts to perfect and those times where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">mistakes happen</a>, these events cumulatively collect in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">clients consciousness</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">Clients adapt</a> in reverse too and coupled with the desire not to have seen to have made a mistake, even if a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">substandard MSP</a> when compared to your organization takes over, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">increase in ticket completion</a>, the delays in getting tasks that prior to the change over did not exist along with their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff</a> just not being as effective as before, it will all be put down to teething issues. It is rare that an organization will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">admit they made a mistake</a> after having come to the conclusion that their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">old MSP</a> was substandard.</p>
<p>I know it can happen as I have heard stories of clients coming back to an MSP but I never experienced this either in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">my own business</a> or those I have worked for. All I can say is if that has happened to your business and you have been able to overcome the hurdle of the client having to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">admit they were wrong</a> then you must be running one hell of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting list of apps involved in disaster recovery failures">good operation</a>.</p>
<p>Either that or you are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">undercharging</a> by a significant margin. If it was me, I would certainly be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">increasing my agreement value</a> for a returning client and there would have to be some pretty compelling reasons why I would allow a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">client that walked away</a> because they thought we were not good enough to come back.</p>
<p>The one compelling reason built in though is their willingness to admit they got it wrong. That is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">rare quality</a> to have in today's business world.</p>
<p>Familiarity breeding contempt is not all one sided though, it goes both ways. As the leader of an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">MSP operation</a> you need to keep a close eye on the behavior and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">attitudes your staff</a> has with regards to your clients.</p>
<p>I have seen <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">support desk staff</a> gradually behave <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">unprofessionally towards client staff</a> as well as seeing how quickly a good help desk can go rotten due to one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">senior technical staff</a> member.</p>
<p>This needs to be consistently monitored and when observed, nipped in the bud. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">Tech staff</a> will gradually get irritated with the same <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">usual suspects</a> ringing up with the same problems and after a while they become conditioned to the idea that the people on the other end are morons and this perception starts to seep in via their behavior and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">written communication</a> to the point it is not only noticeable but <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">highly unprofessional</a>.</p>
<p>The other way this behavior takes hold is when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">senior tech</a> has the attitude that anyone who does not know as much as them is not worth their time. Of course <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">junior help desk staff</a> tend to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">need role models</a> and so this behavior will start being exhibited in all of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">support desk</a> if it is not eliminated quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">Your staff</a> should be taught that the only reason they have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employment</a> working in I.T is because they know more than others about information technology and the day they do not know as much as the people on the other end of the phone is the day they will no longer be needed.</p>
<p>Compassion and the ability to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">help those client staff</a> who continually struggle with technology or who have an &ldquo;<em>interesting or high strung personality</em>&rdquo; should be a high priority for any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">support desk</a>. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">Hiring support staff</a> who are able to empathize and tolerate a large variation of personalities is very important if a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">support desk</a> is to be successful.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">One Reason Given - Two Real Reasons</h2>
<p>Aside from some outliers such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">corruption</a>, merging or actual <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">technical incompetence</a> there is one primary reason clients say they are leaving an MSP and that is some type of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">performance issue</a>.</p>
<p>Of course most of the time, they do not have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">base skillset</a> to determine if the MSPs performance is deserving of being labeled poor or substandard as there are an almost infinite amount of variables that contribute to that.</p>
<p>Often those variables are due to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client based decisions</a> (Example: Refusing a MSP proposal for an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">appropriate backup solution</a> and then complaining when the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backup solution</a> in place fails to satisfy the specific scenario the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup clients overview">proposed backup solution</a> would have satisfied)</p>
<p>There are 2 actual reasons why the vast majority of MSP clients will leave, the first and smallest of these two groups are the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">predatory organizations</a> that choose weak MSPs that are incapable of defending themselves.</p>
<p>They go in with the plan of gradually racking up a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">sizable debt</a> before disputing it and walking away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will almost always from the very start ensure that they use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">outstanding invoices</a> as a stick to get you to do more work so that you end up on a never ending treadmill of chasing what you are owed and yet being unable to walk away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They know that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">owing you money</a> is power and they use it until the amount is enough for you to put your foot down. They will then begin the hunt for the next victim and the 18 month cycle will begin all over again. This is a relatively small number of organizations on a sliding scale.</p>
<p>The second real reason is because often people end up disliking each other over a long time frame coupled with both sides often taking each other for granted. It could almost be said that a good 50% of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">client/MSP relationships</a> have a shelf life of between 2-5 years before they move on.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">How To Retain More MSP Clients?</h2>
<p>This in my book is the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is how do I determine which <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">existing and or potential clients</a> are the true diamonds that are run by people that stay loyal over a long time frame and that you really have to mess things up before they will look at <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">terminating a relationship</a>.</p>
<p>It seems the law of averages deems that every MSP organization has everything being equal, about 10% of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">clientbase</a> that could be considered the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">perfect client</a>. In my own MSP, I had clients that were with me from the start right the way to when I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">sold the business</a>.</p>
<p>They <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">generated the most income</a> and caused the least pain. The question needs to be, how do I increase my clientbase so that it holds the majority of clients in this category.</p>
<p>There are many ways to do it including putting all clients into categories such as A/B/C/D and looking to eliminate the D category until you are at capacity and there are no D category clients left and then moving onto the C category clients until at some point you are left with only <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">A class clients</a>.</p>
<p>I am not going to pretend that is easy, it is hard to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">terminate a client relationship</a> when they are on paper bringing in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">income</a>. It is however the answer, the less difficult and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">underperforming clients</a> that you have in your MSP, the more success you will have.</p>
<p>Imagine if you say your top 5% of clients were 100% of your clients? It would be like a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting statistics on msp hardware purchasing">license to print money</a> because you could take on even more 5% level clients because of all the extra time as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">making more money</a> on each service agreement.</p>
<p>So aggressively trimming the fat (I do not mean getting rid of the fat people) while looking for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">potential clients</a> that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">value loyalty</a> is the single best way to both reduce the chance of your clients leaving and improve your chances of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">financial success</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Removing and ignoring that there are a small number of clients that target weaker MSPs to use and abuse them, the single remaining reason clients leave MSPs is down to relationship breakdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not matter how the relationship got to that point, the only takeaway here is it has nothing to do with an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">MSPs technical abilities</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">servicing levels</a>, they may well be above the industry recommended standard and you could be hitting all of the SLAs with room to spare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is because the client has become so used to you that they have decided that their day will be improved by you not being in it and the massive hassle of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">offboarding your service</a> is worth the effort so that you are not part of their day going forward.</p>
<p>It sounds harsh but that is what it boils down to. The solution to this is finding clients that have above average levels of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">loyalty towards their business relationships</a>. Displacing the majority of clients out there that gradually have contempt for you due to the familiarity with which both organizations have for each other is a great long term aim.</p>
<p>That is the secret to reducing the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">amount of clients</a> that leave your MSP and that is to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/diagram-standardization">highly selective</a> of the clients you do bring on while being absolutely merciless in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">cutting the existing clients</a> that do not consistently meet your standards.</p>
<p>You are the prize and you need to give that perception to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">potential clients</a>. Make it appear like a club that they are likely not going to be a member of.</p>
