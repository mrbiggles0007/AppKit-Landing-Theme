<p>Interesting statistics on MSP Hardware purchasing as well as common service provider statistics will be the focus of today's article. The only thing that excites me more than discussing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware purchases</a> as an MSP is documentation strategies.</p>

<p>Today however I will be straight up listing some common statistics that are interesting and may assist in giving you ideas on how to come up with the best <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware purchasing strategy</a> for your organization.</p>
