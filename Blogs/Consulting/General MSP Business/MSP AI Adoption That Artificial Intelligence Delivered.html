<p>MSP AI adoption and&nbsp;benefits to managed service providers that artificial intelligence is and has brought to our industry will be the topic of today&rsquo;s article.</p>
<p>AI MSP uptake has been quite volatile in the last few years and that it seems is due to providers dipping their toes in the water and finding out the current crop of tools are not up to standard and so cancel quite quickly. MSP AI uptake also suffers from the overhyping the media is currently engaging in and so that leaves business owners feeling disappointed in the current AI capabilities in many of the MSP tools currently available.</p>
<p>While my <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/chatgpt-index-page-01">experience with Ai</a> in the MSP space has not been as revolutionary as I had hoped, there is no doubt it is and will make certain repetitive tasks <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">far more cost effective</a>.</p>
<p>Of course a rising tide lifts all boats as they say and with every new advantage, it generally means we all end up working harder while providing a more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">efficient service</a> to our <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">MSP clients</a>.</p>
<p>In this article I am going to discuss the hopes we all have had with AI, what it is and is not along with some of the issues it has begun to eliminate. I will also discuss areas it is likely to dominate with time and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/overview of chatgpt and its use with technical documentation relating to managed service providers">areas AI has failed in</a>.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">AI Use In Managed Service Providers</h2>
<p>Having used <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/benefits of using chatgpt for technical documentation in managed services">Artificial intelligence products</a> such as ChatGPT and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for customer support and service">Google Bard</a> for a good year now, I am left feeling as though it is mislabeled. Ultimately there is no more intelligence in ChatGPT than there is in an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/cloud apps overview">SQL database</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I admit when I was first <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for it infrastructure">exposed to ChatGPT</a>, I thought it was magic and was shocked at how well it could <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">write an article</a>. However after <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for it infrastructure">being exposed to AI</a> over a significant period of time, the cracks begin to appear and for me anyway, I am left with the impression it is not magic, it is more a box of magic tricks.</p>
<p>My personal view is that AI in its current form is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/overview of chatgpt and its use with technical documentation relating to managed service providers">nothing more than hype</a> and it will remain that way for as long as it takes humans to develop true artificial intelligence which is likely a century or two away if at all and would require a number of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">technologies yet to be invented</a> and for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/scientific &amp; laboratory computer hardware">scientists</a> to at least understand let alone reproduce an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/generating technical documentation for artificial intelligence with chatgpt">artificial self aware conscience</a>.</p>
<p>This article will concentrate on the areas that managed service providers can benefit from Artificial intelligence such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for collaboration between technical writers and subject matter experts">chatbots</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">VOIP answering services</a> which have proven themselves capable.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">How Can AI Improve Your MSP Business?</h2>
<p>As it currently stands, think of the use you get from a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">substandard personal assistant</a> and that is where artificial intelligence stands, the main difference is that even the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">worst personal assistant</a> only needs to be asked to do something a maximum of about 4 times before <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">producing an acceptable outcome</a>.</p>
<p>AI on the other hand can be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">extremely volatile</a> in its responses and often the one thing that makes it <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for generating technical documentation for both internal and external use">appear so human</a> is how unpredictable and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">lacking in consistency</a> it actually is.</p>
<p>Asking ChatGPT to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">create H2 headings</a> on an article took me 15 different prompts before I finally gave up for the day. The following day, the original prompt worked without issue 3 times before failing twice then working again. The upshot is, it took less time to just <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">manually create the heading</a> using H2 in html.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Problems AI Creates For Your MSP</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">problems MSPs face</a> due to artificial intelligence are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">primarily security related</a>. Now where problems occur, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">opportunities for MSPs</a> open so perhaps beefing up the number of staff that specialize in AI related security prevention and remediation could be a good profit generator.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Increased Threats From Incompetent Fools</h4>
<p>The biggest issue <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/chatgpt msp general - index">artificial intelligence causes</a> service providers is that the ability for individuals with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">no specialist knowledge</a> along with no grasp of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/overview of chatgpt and its use with technical documentation relating to managed service providers">English language</a> to become a threat to both you and your clients, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">risk from the incompetent</a> has gone through the roof.</p>
<p>In other words, once there was the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">barrier of expertise</a> and comprehension of English both written and spoken. The written word prior to AI was always the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">steepest learning curve</a> as many can speak a language but are unable to write in that language as that is a far more difficult ability to obtain and usually <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">requires years of training</a> and exposure.</p>
<p>With artificial intelligence though, all they need is to be able to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/chatgpt msp apps - index">copy and paste a prompt</a> into ChatGPT and they do not even have to understand what is being written. So instead of dealing with 50-100 million <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">competent individuals</a> worldwide who may or may not decide to join the dark side, you are dealing with billions of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">incompetent individuals</a> who have access to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">free tools</a> that circumvent the need for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">specialist skills</a>.</p>
<p>Couple that with the ability for the likes of ChatGPT to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/chatgpt msp apps - index">create programs</a> where the person creating them has no clue how to program and you can begin to see how the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security vulnerability overview">number of threats</a> to our organizations as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">our clients</a> are significantly increasing.</p>
<p>This is not overblown either, I have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">created many programs</a> using ChatGPT and I have trouble <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer components">changing drives</a> using a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/operating systems overview">command prompt</a>. In other words, I have no clue how to program and yet I can get a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/apps-index-page-01">failing program</a> that looks like gibberish to function without issue within a short amount of time.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Becoming a Generic No Name MSP</h4>
<p>Becoming a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">faceless MSP</a> that has as a first line, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">AI bots</a> greeting your clients, it can no doubt save you money however every MSP I know is gravitating towards more automation using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">AI welcome bots</a> at every entry point to their business.</p>
<p>It sounds efficient and effective however have a think about the last time you attempted contact with a company only to be greeted by an obvious <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt for interpereting existing logfiles">online support bot</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is incredibly <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">frustrating for the client</a> because often they already know the bot is not going to be able to assist with the problem they have and they know 5 mins of their time is about to be wasted talking to an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">IT support</a> bot that is not going to be able to rectify the problem they are having.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Sorting Reality From Fantasy</h4>
<p>Anytime a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">revolutionary technology appears</a>, there is a tendency to overhype it and suddenly we are faced with a never ending mountain of articles claiming it can undertake tasks that in reality it cannot. Artificial intelligence is no exception here.</p>
<p>The moment something is labeled as AI, it seems it takes on some sort of mystical aura and it is assumed to be next level. So you find almost all products now have AI either in their name or included as a feature much like during the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">90s internet boom</a> where mining companies were changing their names to take advantage of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">information superhighway</a> craze. The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/inheriting existing msp backups">insanity of human nature</a> really does amaze me sometimes.</p>
<p>The best way to overcome this avalanche of information is to ask questions in forums where there is a significant concentration of MSP owners such as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/">MSP subreddit</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/">Sys Admin subreddit</a> as they tend to be highly critical of products and services that are hype and do not live up to expectations.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Security Issues And Liability</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">Most staff</a> if allowed to use AI in the workplace will use something like ChatGPT and this causes a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">significant security concern</a> because I would assume that at least some of the items they are inputting into ChatGPT are going to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security incidents msp - index">confidential and sensitive</a>.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security vulnerabilities - index">hackers</a> smarter than I will ever be are sniffing out ways in which they can leverage these types of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security stack overview">information leaks</a> in a new generation of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">corporate ransom demands</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure whatever <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">version of AI</a> you use, you keep it offline and that your MSP does not sign away the rights of either your information, your clients information or the correspondence between you both otherwise you probably need to double check the quality of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/client expectations on enterprise backup solutions">cyber security insurance policy</a> because at some point it is going to be needed.</p>
<p>Certainly and especially if you are using AI for responses to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">paying clients</a> and it gives a response that ends up causing damage then it is likely your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">cyber insurance</a> will have to pay out.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Solutions Artificial Intelligence Solves</h2>
<p>Below are some of the solutions that MSP AI either already solves or is coming close to solving.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Documentation Within An MSP</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">Helping technical staff</a> create documentation is one of the bigger tasks that AI is solving to a level that can be considered effective although a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">strict framework</a> is required to ensure this is undertaken effectively.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Help Desk Ticket Entries</h4>
<p>This has been a problem for as long as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">help desk systems</a> have existed and that is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">help desk technicians</a> either not entering any detail, not enough detail or pointless details in a ticket.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Ticket entries</a> are for historical as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">fault finding purposes</a>, specifically for other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">help desk engineers</a> so that they can follow the steps taken and ideally use the notes to rectify future issues or problems that still exist.</p>
<p>It is infuriating to see entries like &ldquo;<em>started working on ticket</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Claudia rang and began assisting with her problem</em>&rdquo; First there are time stamps so by recording they started working on something is redundant and second the ticket is recorded under the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff members name</a> in most cases and is also redundant.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence can help <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">substandard technicians</a> to record the steps taken because it can do 90% of the written work. Because <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">ticket entries</a> are about the steps taken, it does not matter that they appear to be repetitive, using the same words every time because the purpose is not to look good, it is functional in nature.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend either <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/training chatgpt to generate documentation that aligns with your companys brand and tone">training your own version of ChatGPT</a> or using a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">help desk system</a> that has an AI component that does not use pointless flowery language where 100 words are used to say something that could have been written using 8 words.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Email Communication</h4>
<p>This is a tricky one because artificial intelligence is actually pretty easy to detect once you have even a small amount of exposure to it so I would not want to be in a position where I am having delicate discussions with say an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">MSP client</a> for them to catch me using AI in my replies.</p>
<p>Using it for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">internal communications</a> or with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">some vendors</a> is ok however whenever I have discovered someone has been using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">AI in emails</a> to me, I feel cheated and any future correspondence between that person is devalued automatically in my mind and it is a judgment made that I have no choice in.</p>
<p>I do not use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">AI in emails</a> unless I really do not care if the person on the other end realizes that this is occurring. Examples would be an inquiry to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors/vendors directly contacting clients">potential vendor</a> or asking a number of questions to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top 36 applications and solutions for automotive">mechanic</a> about tasks on my car that need rectifying.</p>
<p>I would definitely give careful consideration about using AI in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">client correspondence</a> both in and out of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">service desk environment</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Information Tagging</h4>
<p>There are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/chatgpt as a tool for creating technical documentation for managed print services">AI products</a> on the market that are competent in their ability to tag knowledge base articles or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">standard operating procedures</a> to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">service tickets</a> using artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>AI munches through all of your information and gives it an appropriate tag and I will say, this is an otherwise <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">labor intensive task</a> that without AI is almost always never undertaken and yet brings significant improvements to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">information discovery</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Dispatching Duties</h4>
<p>AI is becoming proficient enough in the role of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">help desk dispatching</a> that from what I have seen, it can eliminate around 70% of the workload of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">single dispatcher</a> without staff realizing their dispatcher is now an AI support bot.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/creating technical documentation for cloud-based solutions with chatgpt">AI achieves better outcomes</a> because once set up you can prioritize and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">categorize service tickets automatically</a>. I have not tested this on anything other than <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps are moving to halo psa">HaloPSA</a> with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">third party application</a> so you would need to check if your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">PSA is capable</a> of integrating this automation.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Summary</h2>
<p>My view is that people want to work with people. Developing a cutting edge <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">AI based MSP</a> that costs almost nothing to run sounds good in theory however surely we have already learnt that you can throw<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform"> guide after guide</a> at a client and it can be perfect in every way along with being easy to find.</p>
<p>The client still ends up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com">creating a ticket</a>. That trend is not going to change. AI however is starting to become<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index"> useful and cost effective</a> for simple repetitive tasks on the MSP side of the equation, so the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">back end operations</a> where the client does not need to know.</p>
<p>Think of how techs since the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">search engines</a> were invented, being asked a question and then googling the answer. Doing that in front of a client is not a good look but we all do it. Perception is what MSPs deal in and relying on AI should not be something your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">MSP client</a> either needs to know about or needs to be exposed to.</p>
<p>Finally, if you come across posts or an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">MSP owner</a> telling you how much they rely on artificial intelligence to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">run their business</a>, be highly skeptical because from what I have seen, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation for project management">highest level of AI</a> use is probably getting it to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/writing powershell scripts with chatgpt">write a powershell script</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">automate scheduling</a> because in its current state, AI is not able to reliably and consistently undertake anything close to a complex task.</p>
