<p>High profile MSP disaster recovery attempts that failed is the uplifting topic of today&rsquo;s article. There are people out there with happy lives that sit by lakes eating noodle salads, just nobody in this article.</p>
<p>Were you aware that 2 out of 3 midsized companies were affected by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">ransomware</a> in the last 18 months? Or that 93% of businesses that lose access to their information for more than 11 days go <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">bankrupt</a> within one year?</p>
<p>So strap yourself into that favorite chair of yours and let the overwhelming feeling of thankfulness wash over you that you are not one of the following organizations involved in the listed <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">MSP horror stories</a>.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>Failed MSP Disaster Recovery Attempts</h2>
<p>The definition of a failed disaster recovery attempt is anything where any amount of data could <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/oracle zero data loss recovery appliance vs acronis cyber appliance">not be recovered</a>. So it does not mean that 100% of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">data was not recoverable</a>, it means anywhere from 1% up to 100% of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">data loss</a> are in the examples below.</p>
<p>Disaster recovery attempts that failed in my book are any incidents where the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">company suffers significant damage</a> even if the actual recovery attempt is eventually successful. If the data recovery component of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">disaster recovery strategy</a> is 100% effective yet it took 15 days to recover all of the information then that cannot be considered successful.</p>
<p>Even so-called <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">data recovery specialists</a> often take an up front payment before negotiating a payment of ransom in the case of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security services overview">ransomware infections</a>. Sometimes there is an unhealthy relationship between <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security incidents msp - index">hackers</a> that infect with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/mssps - index">ransomware and security</a> companies that offer to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security stack overview">decrypt the information</a>.</p>
<p>A small silver lining is that many of the companies hit are still running today. The list of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">MSP failures</a> below should certainly prompt even the most live on the edge, risk everything MSP out there to invest in the best <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">data breach recovery coverage</a> they possibly can.</p>
<p>Threats are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01">attacking MSPs</a> on all sides these days and often the biggest defense is similar to the old club lock they used to use on cars, the thieves will just move onto another vehicle.</p>
<p>The problem comes of course when you put a club lock on something like a Ferrari and the thief wants that vehicle. This analogy holds true with service providers, if the hacker wants your information, very little is going to stop them.</p>
<p>That is where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">cyber insurance coverage</a> will come into play. So let's now take a look at some of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">horrifying MSP stories</a> so that we can both learn from them as well as entertain ourselves.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Revolut - 2022</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.revolut.com/">Revolut</a> is a tech company involved in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">financial services</a>, a third party services organization to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">banks</a> if you will as well as consumer based products such as credit cards and travel products.</p>
<p>It has been reported they lost 20 million dollars over a period of 3 to 6 months due to a flaw in its <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">payment system</a>.</p>
<p>I hold no judgments however Revolut uses <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">automatic account banning</a> while simultaneously not having enough staff to unban accounts for sometimes months. I am not saying a company that engages in this type of behavior deserves to be targeted, actually that probably is what I am saying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any company that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a> as a cover to profit from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">freezing accounts</a> to earn large sums of interest free cash while decent clients that have done nothing wrong are locked out of their accounts for up to 6 months without any notice or communication, they deserve to be driven into the ground in my book.</p>
<p>Couple that with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">shady employment practices</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">exceptionally high staff turnover</a> and it sounds exactly like a business that, well, does not deserve to be in business.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">MOVEit - 2023</h4>
<p>This company forces me to think of that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdcTmpvDO0I">little monkey</a> thing in the movie Ice Age &ldquo;<em>I like to move it move it song</em>&rdquo; Apologies if&nbsp; I have caused an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earworm">earworm</a>. This <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/mssp overview">data breach</a> like many tech organization data breaches is like the head of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa">Medusa</a>, you cut the head of one snake off and another 2 appear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ipswitch.com/moveit">MOVEit</a> is software designed by Ipswitch that ironically<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview"> encrypts files</a>. Now their customers had customers of their own who had customers of their own etc so you can see how as quick as a flash, over 600 organizations were impacted by this one <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">security event</a>.</p>
<p>I consider this more of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Horse">trojan horse</a> even when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">small file encryption application</a> used by a large number of organizations is compromised and then at some point once it is safely embedded, then the CIOp vermin activates at will. The amount of impacted people is around the 40 million mark.</p>
<p>This is definitely a slow burn intrusion of which the impact has not been completely figured out as yet.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">TSM Consulting - 2019</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">Printers</a> automatically burst to life with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security vulnerability overview">ransom demands</a> within 22 government organizations in Texas after an MSP called <a href="http://www.tlets.net/">TSM Consulting</a> was hit by a ransomware demand using the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Control application</a> to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">encrypt</a> squadrillions of bytes of client data.</p>
<p>Residents were unable to pay their council rates, local government could not pay bills, even police departments were frozen out of vital records during this time.</p>
<p>TSM contracted the services of a security related organization called MonsterCloud which has a reputation for often paying ransoms. Is this a failed disaster recovery if you have to pay the ransom? I will let you determine that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/15/ransomware-samsam-payments-bitcoin-scam"><em>Another US company, Florida-based MonsterCloud, also professes to use its own data recovery methods but instead pays ransoms, sometimes without informing victims such as local law enforcement agencies, ProPublica has found.</em></a>&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Travelex - 2019</h4>
<p>This is a company most of us have either heard of or used. In 2019, <a href="https://www.travelex.com">Travelex</a> was impacted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REvil">REvil ransomware</a> and after being offline for 2 weeks, caused the collapse of the organization including the loss of 1000 jobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be fair <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19</a> probably did not help either however the ransomware was still the contributing factor in the organization's demise and subsequent restructure and new ownership.</p>
<p>Over 5GB of user information was encrypted and the hackers demanded around 6 million big ones for its restoration. They ended up negotiating the ransom down to about 2.3 million dollars.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">United Structures of America Inc - 2019</h4>
<p>Another horrendous attack which wiped out all areas of data including <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/industrial computers">CNC machinery</a> files, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">current order information</a> as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">customer information</a>.</p>
<p>This is another organization that has been <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">forced into bankruptcy</a> by a ransomware attack. Even with an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">electronic data protection policy</a>, the best plan in the world is not going to save a company who has every type of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">data encrypted</a>.</p>
<p>You know what is worse? They <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">paid the ransom</a> and the scoundrels either did not hand over the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security resources overview">decryption tools</a> or they did not work and so the business had no choice but to wind down operations.</p>
<p>This event demonstrates that preparation against security attacks is as important as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">good insurance</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Noteworthy Mentions</h4>
<p>Shein which is a fashion brand that came to light during the pandemic was fined 1.9 million smackers recently due to a data breach that occurred back in 2018. The reason for the fine?<br />They chose not to disclose that a breach occurred. A drop in the ocean perhaps but still shows that if you ignore data breach protocols, you will likely get found out.</p>
<p>Nelnet Servicing had 2.5 million users confidential information leaked due to a vulnerability in their systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter as it was known then or X saw 5.4 million accounts stolen and being held to ransom for a quite reasonable $30,000 by all accounts. I suspect the fine for failing to disclose the data breach will be far higher than the actual ransom demand.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you have a large enough target on your head then you will be hit by ransomware at some point. It is not enough to sit back and expect your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">cyberinsurance</a> to do the heavy lifting. It is quite likely that their payout will be both conditional and limited depending on the countermeasures you previously put in place.</p>
<p>It also shows that as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">MSPs</a>, we are in a position to cause significant levels of catastrophic damage to our clients if our own systems are compromised. Using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">best in class security applications</a> as well as ensuring that you at least offer the absolute <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security stack - index">best possible security measures</a> to your clients as well as keeping on top of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">security patching and updates</a>.</p>
<p>Above all though and this is probably the hardest thing to do, try and remain under the radar as much as possible. Pretty tough to do if you have high profile clients I know but if you can make sure that you are the least attractive option then they will move onto another target.</p>
<p>By all means, go to the dance, just perhaps forget the makeup and high heels.</p>
