<p>Intriguing facts about Managed service providers will be the topic of today's article. You know some professions really struggle to appear glamorous or interesting. Thankfully when it comes to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">MSP world</a>, there is so much excitement, intrigue and fascination that this article pretty much writes itself.</p>
<p>Nothing is off limits here, I will be touching on subjects that are close to my heart such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup solutions</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">financial intrigue</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">general consulting factoids</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do sometimes find it odd that even though I have been at the front line of this fascinating world for about 30 years now, for some weird reason, I still have to invite myself to parties and whenever I bring up exciting topics such as upcoming <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">VOIP technology</a> or the the nuance of an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">adequate I.T risk mitigation strategy</a>, I notice people in my vicinity giving each other knowing looks and informing me they need to get another drink even though their glasses still appear quite full. Blows my mind but it is their loss.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">27 Of The Most Intriguing MSP Facts</h2>
<p>I am certain that if you can retain even half of the following <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">MSP facts</a>, you will improve your social life significantly. I have nothing more than anecdotal information on this however it cannot hurt.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Recurring Service Revenue</h4>
<p>From the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">break-fix income model</a> of yesteryear where having a small group of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">clueless techs</a> actually helped your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">profit margin</a> to where we are today where 74% of service providers now generate over 55% of their income via recurring <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">service agreements</a> meaning we are now paid more when <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">things do not break</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Small And Medium Business</h4>
<p>This is the sector where managed service providers are most in demand. It makes sense as large businesses above 200 staff tend to have their own <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">internal IT departments</a>. 75% of service providers reported their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">primary clients</a> were <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">small to medium businesses</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Healthcare Industry Is Our Biggest Fan</h4>
<p>75% of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">healthcare organizations</a> utilize the services of an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">external IT service provider</a> making them the largest consumer percentage wise of MSP services.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Financial Industry Gets Second Prize</h4>
<p>Coming in a reasonable distance behind the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">healthcare industry</a> is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">finance sector</a> with 69% of financial organizations using some form of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">3rd party technology</a> services company to manage their IT needs.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Cloud Computing Services Revolution</h4>
<p>I remember when I thought offering an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">outsourced helpdesk</a> was cutting edge. That is now just an expected MSP offering these days. The most popular now however is Online cloud services with 72% of service providers now offering cloud services as their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">primary service offering</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">MSP Prospects</h4>
<p>The best advice I ever got regarding managing <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">technical sales people</a> is to focus 100% on the numbers. They can either achieve the number set for them if it is realistic or they cannot in which case they are not suitable for the sales position. Following that advice helped me quickly filter <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">suitable sales staff</a> in my own MSP.</p>
<p>I was always terrible at the sales process, never enjoyed it and could talk someone lost in the desert out of buying a bottle of water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sales however is without doubt the single most important part of any business to get right. I would on average go to a sales meeting with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">potential new client</a> perhaps once a month and of those sales meetings, I would be lucky to win one in five.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">MSP Client Loyalty Experiences</h4>
<p>The silver lining for me is for whatever reason I tended to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">hold onto clients</a> for a very long time. Actually it was either or, either I would <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">fire my new clients fast</a> or they would stay with me for in most cases the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">life of my business</a> unless their circumstances changed.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">MSP Sales Meetings Ratio</h4>
<p>Even with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">good retention rates</a>, my ability to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">sign on new clients</a> was pretty poor compared to the average. 75% of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">MSP business owners</a> surveyed stated that they went on a minimum of 2 sales meetings per month with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">potential new clients</a>.</p>
<p>I also was never very good at filtering out tyre kickers and firmly believed a lot of those meetings failed before they were even conducted.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Number Of New MSP Clients Per Year</h4>
<p>57% of MSPs surveyed picked up between one and six <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">new clients</a> in a twelve month period, so the majority, which is why <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">most service providers fail</a> within the first 5 years. That amount hardly <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">covers attrition</a> due to things out of your control such as clients being purchased or closing down.</p>
<p>76% of service providers added less than 1 client per month over a 12 month period while the remaining 24% added more than 1.</p>
<p>Below is a graph of the number of clients MSPs, on average collect over a 12 month period. This does not take into account <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">client attrition</a> and so many no doubt are at a net negative at the end of the year.</p>

<p>The issue with low numbers when it comes to sales for service providers is it is a bit like a snowball rolling down hill. Because you do not get very much experience out there selling your offerings, it means you are never going to hit that critical mass of getting good sales experience in a short amount of time.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Look Of Desperation At An MSP Sales Meeting</h4>
<p>So you end up with very few initial sales leads meaning the ones you do get, you are scrambling to sign them on meaning you are more likely to agree to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">outrageous pricing</a> that will not be sustainable. The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">potential client</a> now has the upper hand and you end up often with a client that is only interested in bleeding you dry which is actually worse than no client at all.</p>
<p>If you can get into the upper levels of the number of prospects below that means you will have a steady stream of opportunities and will not be tempted to drop your trousers just to sign them up. If you have abundance then it is more likely that you will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">raise your prices</a> which is exactly the mindset you want.</p>
<p>Take a look at the table below and see where you fall. Work on bumping those numbers up wherever you are currently and do not make the mistake I made of going to sales meetings desperate. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">Potential clients</a>, especially the ones you do not want, can always smell desperation on you.</p>

<h4 class="display-4">Largest MSP Market In The World</h4>
<p>If you guessed the USA then congratulations. We account for 42% of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">global MSP market</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Most Commonly Used MSP Service Offering</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">Remote monitoring</a> And <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp monitoring apps-index-page">Remote Control</a> are the most common <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">recurring agreement offerings</a> provided by managed service companies with 92% of all service providers offering this as a monthly service.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Legal Industry And MSP Use</h4>
<p>There is still plenty of room for growth for MSPs who want to target the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">legal profession</a> with only 43% of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">legal organizations</a> engaging with service providers beyond calling someone when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">Personal computer</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/consumer routers">router</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">digital phone system</a> among others stops working.</p>
<p>My experience with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">legal industry</a> has left me a little jaded. I am sure there are some <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">great legal firms</a> out there that are not stingy who do not <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">ignore your advice</a> and do not <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">forget to pay their bills</a>, I am just saying I have never met one.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder if it is cause and effect in play here where it is actually MSPs giving the industry a wide berth rather than the other way around.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Backup And Recovery Services</h4>
<p>With 82% of all service providers offering some form of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup and recovery strategy</a> including <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud backup solutions</a>, it is no surprise it is the second most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">profitable</a> and widely used service provider offering.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Hospitality Industry And MSPs</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">hospitality industry</a> certainly lags behind in their use of managed service providers with just 22% of these organizations using a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">trusted technology advisor</a>. This may well be due to quite a lot of these businesses having quite <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">simple systems</a> where they buy something <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rugged computers">off the shelf</a> such as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/point of sale">Point of sale</a> which is set and forget these days.</p>
<p>They may well not require the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">level of support</a> that would make it worthwhile.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Government And Public Services</h4>
<p>I never managed to crack this gravy train however plenty of government organizations utilize the services of MSPs with 37% of these organizations engaging in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">service agreement</a>. My experience was that they tended to go for the larger MSPs and I found the entire <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">tender process</a> lacking in excitement and joy.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Managed Mobility Services</h4>
<p>59% organizations are engaging MSPs to manage their entire complement of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/mobile phones for business">mobile devices</a>. Plenty of off the shelf management solutions these days too such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">Meraki</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/vertical apps-index">IBM MaaS360</a> that can handle this task really well.</p>
<p>It has been a while but last time I checked, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">RMM tools</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">Connectwise Automate</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">Atera</a>&nbsp; still struggled with adequately <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/mobile phones for business index">managing mobile devices</a> however things may well have changed.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Educational Organizations</h4>
<p>46% of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">educational organizations</a> use MSPs in some way which means there is still plenty of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">growth potential</a> in this sector.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">MSP Labor Costs</h4>
<p>A good rule of thumb when it comes to calculating if you are heading in the right direction is to check <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">total revenue</a> against <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">staff wages</a>.</p>
<p>For every $10 spent on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">staff wages</a> you should be bringing in at least $30 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">revenue</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Net Profit Margin</h4>
<p>It is pretty important as an MSP to keep track of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">profit margin</a> after everything else has been taken into account and that includes everything from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">hardware</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">staff training</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">renting office space</a>.</p>
<p>Once all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">expenses have been accounted for</a>, you should be aiming for 20% <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">profit margin</a> for the business. By keeping track of this figure, for a start you are not guessing if you are making a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">profit</a> and second you are less likely to be shocked when looking at your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">bank account</a> at the end of the month.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Average Prospect Close Rate Of MSPs</h4>
<p>The average <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">successful closing rate</a> of MSP sales staff across the board is 35%. That means out of 4 initial sales calls, just over 1 is expected to be successful.</p>
<p>As a side note as an MSP owner, you should absolutely be keeping track of your sales staff and how they compare to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">industry standard</a>. If they dip below that 35% consistently then you cannot really consider them a competent sales person.</p>
<p>Someone competent should always be above average, in this case above 35%. If it is permissible in your state then my recommendation is to write a minimum level into their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employment contract</a>. Something that states they must be above 35% a minimum of 10 months out of 12.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Behold The Truth Teller</h4>
<p>Do you really want to know how well your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">managed service business</a> is doing? The one report that will strip all the hope and dreams away and leave you with the truth is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">effective hourly rate report</a>.</p>
<p>I can tell you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">from experience</a>, most managers and owners avoid it like the plague because it has a nasty habit of wiping away that good feeling you have when you have no clue what is actually going on in your business.</p>
<p>I remember working for an MSP many years ago and part of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation improvement project</a> was to run the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">effective hourly rate report</a> so that I could create a front and center <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">flexible asset</a> that would visually indicate to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">support desk</a> how valuable the client was using 10 stars in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-framework">client summary flexible asset</a> I had created.</p>
<p>I was also a little suspicious when looking at <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">agreement values</a> versus the amount of hours that seemed to be spent on some of these clients.</p>
<p>Well, this company was busy as you could be, lots of clients and a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">support desk</a> of around 18 staff. Once I completed the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">effective hourly rate report</a>, I was in shock. Most of their clients had <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">effective hourly rates</a> under $30, some were as low as $10.</p>
<p>I had a meeting with the owner and explained what I had found and he brought in the CFO and I will never forget what he said &ldquo;<em>Yeah they are the same numbers we got last month too</em>&rdquo; with a slight look of worry on his face.</p>
<p>They thanked me for my effort and asked me to keep it to myself. A month later the business was sold to a massive Asian MSP and my own thought was that they probably sold it at the exact right time.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Cost Of Poor MSP Documentation</h4>
<p>Lost time due to preventable delays because of bad <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">MSP documentation strategies</a> in completing tasks has a direct cost of $14,000 per <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">technical employee</a> averaged out with a loss of opportunity cost of $35,000 per <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">technician</a> on average. Nothing comes close to the potential cost savings to an MSP as undertaking an overhaul of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">poorly planned documentations strategy</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Average Ransom Paid In An MSP Breach</h4>
<p>The average <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">ransom demand payment</a> made by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">MSP insurance companies</a> is $800,000. Of the 7,000 claims paid out by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">MSP insurance companies</a>, greater than 99% were classed as small to medium business with less than 1% being <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/enterprise drives purchased from amazon - warning">enterprise</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a table that lists the most common reasons for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">claims paid out</a> all the way to the least common reasons and I have to admit some of these were a bit of a surprise although I did expect <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">ransomware</a> to be the top reason. Unfortunately they are also the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">most expensive payouts</a> as well. The categories are actual categories listed by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">insurance companies</a> and some of them may appear to overlap and often a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">claim</a> would be made for more than one event. This lists only the primary reason listed.</p>
