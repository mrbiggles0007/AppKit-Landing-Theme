<p>MSP income and some of the shocking facts you may not be aware of is the topic of today's article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service provider industry is changing slowly as business now relies so heavily on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">technology related services</a> however to this day, nobody needs a degree or license to start up an MSP. It still remains an industry sector that is not <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">heavily regulated</a>.</p>
<p>This will be a light hearted article on some interesting facts on MSP income and where it comes from and how much everyone actually makes on average.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">MSP Revenue Increase</h2>
<p>Business has become ever more reliant on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">3rd party IT related service offerings</a> and total <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">global MSP market gross revenue</a> is on track to have increased by 25% over 2022.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Security Services</h2>
<p>While I am quite skeptical of the sudden increase in &ldquo;<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">security experts</a>&rdquo; in the MSP space and even more concerned when I see traditional MSPs rebranding themselves as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/mssp overview">MSSPs</a> which on the surface is a response to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about managed service providers">market demands</a>, I do not see a corresponding <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">increase in security skills</a> to offset these claims.</p>
<p>97% of MSPs now offer some form of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security services - index">security service agreements</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a table showing the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security services - index">security services offered</a> and the participation rate of service providers against each service offering.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">MSP Client Value Perception</h2>
<p>60% of 1000 MSP clients surveyed indicate that they have experienced significant <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">cost savings</a> by engaging the services of a technology service provider.</p>
<p>I am actually a little surprised at how low that is and suspect it may be due to clients not fully comprehending the benefits service providers bring with them.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Internal IT Versus MSPs</h2>
<p>Again I am surprised that the cost savings involved are only 70% when compared to managing an complete <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">internal IT department</a>. Take a look at the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">following article</a> for a more in depth discussion on this.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Outsourcing All Or Part Of IT</h2>
<p>With 30K organizations surveyed it has been found that 67% of all companies regardless of size outsource either all or part of their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">IT management</a> as well as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">tech related projects</a>.</p>
<p>While that is a significant chunk, it is still far from a saturated market. While some things have become easier there has actually been a significant increase in complexity as far as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud computing</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">risk management</a> are concerned.</p>
<p>Once businesses get to a certain size where they need <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">technology support</a>, there is nearly always that gap between being big enough they need external technology support and too small to be able to make having an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">internal IT department</a> a realistic proposition.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Remote Support</h2>
<p>Currently 54% of all survey responses indicate that 95% or higher of the work they do is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">remote support</a>. I think there is a point where this trend will go the other way a little simply because of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security stack - index">security and risk minimization</a>.</p>
<p>Take for instance the significant <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">increase in ransomware</a> where events have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">massive financial impact</a> and there is going to be a growing push to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/mssps - index">harden security</a> with more extreme measures. For instance <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">domain controllers</a> with no ability to be able to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">remotely access</a> as an example. When a problem occurs on a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">primary server</a> that cannot be accessed via the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">internet</a> and cannot be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp monitoring apps overview">remotely controlled</a>, it leaves one final option and that is an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">onsite visit</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">MSP Longevity</h2>
<p>55% of service providers regardless of size have been in business between 5 and 12 years while around 28% have been in business less than 5 years.</p>
<p>New blood is continually circulated through as time goes on although the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/microsoft-teams-integration">MSP industry</a> continues its slow march towards commoditization of a significant number of services it provides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is helped by the emergence of very capable English speaking tech companies working out of places like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines">Philippines</a> who specialize on integrating their personnel into western MSPs as their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">off the shelf help desk</a>.</p>
<p>I have seen these guys work and they can <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">integrate seamlessly</a> with your team and the client is not even aware they are talking to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff outside of the US</a>. Of course this puts downward pressure on agreement values and it becomes a fight to the bottom.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Positive Outlook For MSPs?</h2>
<p>While we have been through a pretty weird couple of years and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">inflation</a> went rogue recently, it looks like things are starting to look up a bit. Inflation seems to be slowing a little and the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employment rate</a> remains low.</p>
<p>98% of survey respondents indicated that now is a great time to run a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">managed service provider organization</a> and feel that the largest risk to their business is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">increased competition</a> in the marketplace with 30% citing that as their biggest concern.</p>
<p>88% of all service providers surveyed indicated that they expect their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">revenue to increase</a> over the next 5 years and of those 76% expect <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">growth</a> of higher than 5%.</p>
<p>It is not all beer and skittles though, 10% of respondents had seen a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">drop in revenue</a> in the previous 12 months.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Average Agreement Value</h2>
<p>This one surprised me as I thought it would be quite a bit higher. Here is a table on the average yearly spend on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">service agreements</a> for MSPs across the board.</p>

      <td>Over $30,000</td>

<h2 class="display-6">Size Of MSP Clients</h2>
<p>74% of clients are between 20 and 210 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">staff</a>. This also correlates to being the most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">profitable</a> size and is the target demographic for improving income for MSPs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes sense as with less than 20 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff</a>, clients are really still going through <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">growing pains</a> and have not yet reached an appropriately mature stage while above 220 staff, they tend to really work those thumb screws really well as far as locking in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">far lower prices</a> than you may otherwise accept.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">gross profit margin</a> on volume blinds you to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">common sense</a> along with the fact many organizations above this size are likely to have an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">internal IT department</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Annual MSP Income</h2>
<p>Below is a table of the breakdown of income across all surveyed MSPs. Of the total yearly income, 58% of service providers attributed 100% of their income to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">recurring service agreements</a>. 35% of the total income across all service providers came from ad hoc on demand <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">hourly based work</a>.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are definitely a few surprises in these results and one thing is for certain, the move to the cloud is unstoppable. With 98% of MSPs have at least some of their offerings in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud</a> and 78% of service providers intending on moving <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">significant components</a> of their operations onto the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-cloud-index">cloud</a> within the next 2 years, it is quite clear that the bulk of MSP income is now coming from service offerings originating from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/should msps backup google workspace">online locations</a>.</p>
