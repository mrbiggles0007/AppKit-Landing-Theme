<p>Documentation management and how MSPs commonly fail in this arena will be the topic of today&rsquo;s article. If you are anything like me then you know that the topic of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">MSP documentation</a> gives me a mild chubby.</p>
<p>**I apologize profusely, over 2,000 words and I am only two points in of the 30 points promised and it is a hassle to change the url name and do the redirects etc so please ignore the url name of this page.</p>
<p>I just love the way in which if you set up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">help desk documentation</a> in a structured way then with a reasonable amount of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff training</a>, you can get the satisfaction not felt since putting together a <a href="https://www.meccano.com/">meccano set</a> as a child.</p>
<p>We all have to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">make a living</a> and so take on jobs that do not always give us that deep sense of achievement. The jobs that fall into this category for me are when <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">our team</a> is engaged to manage one specific component in an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">MSP documentation project</a>. So for example putting in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">password naming convention</a> or implementing a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">document naming structure</a>.</p>

<p>I may get a little <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">bump of satisfaction</a> at the end but it is nothing like the feeling of having a client come to us knowing their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">documentation framework</a> has grown &ldquo;<em>organically</em>&rdquo; as in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">zero planning</a> since 1998 and now they have reached a size where they understand that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">lack of planning</a> and organization is holding them back if not, making them go backwards.</p>
<p>When they are over 15 technical staff, have been using a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation framework app</a> like IT Glue for at least 6 months and have never assigned a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">single dedicated resource</a> to manage a IT documentation project then the only thing I hear is &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/MEcR9C6y3t8?t=62"><em>I want you to draw me like one of your French girls</em></a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>A blank canvas with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">willing client</a>, an understanding that things are going to get worse before they get better and of course the ability to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">afford the project</a> from start to end, what is not to like?</p>
<p>I find the best way to learn is to read about what <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">does not work</a> as well as examples of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">people doing things wrong</a> so that I can ensure I do not <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">make the same mistake</a>. So with that in mind, I am going to list a couple of really important examples of common mistakes MSPs make with their documentation both their clients and their internal documentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Would an idiot do that? And if they would, I do not do that thing</em>&rdquo; Dwight Schrute</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Not Billing Clients For Documentation</h2>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/is billing clients to test backups normal">Not billing clients for documentation</a> is the biggest problem I see and one that has the greatest impact on service providers. Stop shoe horning client documentation between &ldquo;<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients"><em>proper billable work</em></a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, it does not matter if it is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">part of a project</a> or your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">own technical team</a> has highlighted a deficiency in a client's documentation, you need to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">invoicing for it</a>.</p>
<p>Are you Mother Teresa?&nbsp; Do you want to roam from one town to another dressed in sheets? No, you are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">here to make money</a>, it is not a shameful practice and yet so many service providers tend to have this belief that our clients are our best friends and because they were so benevolent as to sign on to your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">monthly service agreement</a> then anything else should be classed as a freebee.</p>
<p>You should be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp application stack overview">keeping metrics</a> on time it takes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">complete help desk tickets</a> and regularly <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">review repeat tickets</a> and analyze them to ensure there is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">adequate documentation</a> to ensure that your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/backfilling-support-desk">help desk completes</a> it in an effective time frame.</p>
<p>Now if there is not a document exists for that client that is required and it is not a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">simple generic document</a> you can copy from your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Apps/Apps-Index-Page-01">templates</a> then you should either have an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">agreed to monthly budget</a> where the client allows you to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">invoice for extras</a> up to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">pre agreed amount</a> without approval, a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">prepaid block of hours</a> for incidentals like documentation or you need to contact them and obtain approval.</p>
<p>What I see so often is the following thought process which is one of the deadly sins of being an MSP &ldquo;<em>Damn this problem keeps coming up and it's taking 3 times longer than it should because it </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/diagram-standardization"><em>is not documented</em></a><em>. Well, creating the document will save our </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index"><em>support desk time</em></a><em> and make it more efficient so I suppose we should just </em><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee"><em>absorb that cost</em></a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This becomes habit forming and before you know it, you are handing out freebies like it's going out of fashion. This does two things, it <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">reduces your MSP profitability</a> and secondly it reduces your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">support desks capacity</a> to do paid work.</p>
<p>Both ends of the stick. If the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">help desk</a> was not <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">creating documentation for free</a> then they would have more time to undertake work clients are paying for. By doing freebies, you cause pressure on your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">support staff</a> which leads to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">low staff morale</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">increased staff turn over</a> and before you know it you are downing a bottle of vodka before lunch and checking yourself into rehab, it is not healthy for either yourself or your clients.</p>
<p>A simple rule of thumb is the following questions that you need to ask yourself in the table below. If the answers match up to the table below then you absolutely should bill for the work. There would be a sliding scale between a strong yes and a weak yes if some of the answers are different from what is below.</p>

<p>Now there are only two outcomes here, either the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp clients leave">client is going to agree</a> to you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">invoicing</a> for the time it will take to create a document on their behalf or they are going to say no.</p>
<p>This may appear like a very small example of <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/capitulation">capitulation</a> if they say no and you do the work for them anyway &ldquo;<em>because it saves you time in the long run</em>&rdquo; Ever seen one of those big oil tankers where they have a tiny little crack in the steel structure of the ship?</p>
<p>Before the captain has actually registered there is a small stress fracture, whoof, the front half of the ship has detached and is already sinking to the bottom while the crew is hoping the helicopter gets there in time.</p>
<p>This is exactly the same. This one decision is such a big factor in if you are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">going to become a successful MSP</a> and is actually a really good moment to determine if the client is going to become a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">long term client</a> or if you decide to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">terminate the relationship</a> at the next available opportunity.</p>
<p>You are the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">expert organization</a>. I do not care if you are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">one man operation</a> or have 200 staff, the client has hired you because they do not have the capability to maintain and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">manage their own IT systems</a>. They do not have the capability of deciding what is and is not important.</p>
<p>So if they say yes then good work, you have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">established a precedent</a> with them that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">documentation is a billable task</a> outside of the main service agreement.</p>
<p>If they say no then my advice is to either make it clear that they are going against your recommendations and that because their decision will cost you more over time (because the documentation does not exist for the problem) then an option is to advise again in writing as well as verbally, that if this specific problem arises again then you will have no choice but to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">invoice separately outside of the agreement</a>.</p>
<p>Now of course if you are making a killing with this particular client in other areas, say you are making a 50% profit margin on a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">large scale cloud backup solution</a> or they spend big on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/amazing msp facts and figures">regular project work</a> then you need to pick your battles and perhaps you can <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">absorb some documentation tasks</a> but there absolutely needs to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">other income</a> from that client that cushions documentation tasks while leaving an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">adequate profit margin</a>.</p>
<p>In my experience, I got to a point where I stopped doing stuff for free and I stopped using the money I am making on one pile to justify doing free things over here on another pile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That comes with experience and it's a bit like a game of poker. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">Clients will always be testing</a> and looking for weakness, they absolutely will force you to make a decision that risks all of your chips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they see you flinch then they win. All I can say is that by being a little more aggressive in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">protecting my profitability</a> by putting all my chips in on a decision, I personally never had a client walk away because of this that was not already halfway out the door.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">No Strategy For Withholding Company Knowledge</h2>
<p>It is so easy to have a right hand man or 10 who have been with you for a decade and know your clients and procedures like the back of their hand, they are so good they can do their job with their eyes closed and retain a level of information about your business that only years of service creates.</p>
<p>I am sure many of you have been here before, you know, Damo the gun <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">firewall expert</a> who installed pretty much every piece of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">networking equipment</a> in every single one of your top 20 clients over the last 5 years has just advised that &ldquo;<em>I am moving on</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sure you try to hide that gulp on hearing the information and have become acutely aware of the excess perspiration being produced, hoping nobody can smell the fear on you, but your mind races to figure out exactly where all of the documentation Damo must have created over the years for all of those projects actually is.</p>
<p>Well it is not good worrying now because even the most generous <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">resignation notice</a> is not going to help if <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">consistent documentation</a> has not been regularly undertaken and reviewed.</p>
<p>It is easy for me to say that you should have had a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">documentation strategy in place</a> where regular checks and evaluations were made; however, unfortunately, it is not going to help you this time.</p>
<p>So my tip and you can take this to the bank, before the next resignation, undertake a few simple steps so that you are never in this dreadful situation ever again.</p>
<p>Just think for a second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOtYeiTWkaI">when did Noah build the ark? Before the rain, before the rain....</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My best advice here is if you must use your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">senior techs</a> to write documentation (which I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">heavily recommend against</a>) is to put in place a system where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">junior technicians</a> (level 1 up to mid level experienced Level 2 or techs with between 1-6 years experience) are required to use the documentation created when resolving issues.</p>
<p>That sounds nice and easy but you need to be putting in place a system so that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/microsoft-teams-integration">quality of the documentation</a> can be evaluated. Without going into details, I used to use <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">IT Glue workflow rules</a> combined with hooks into <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">MS Teams</a> where alerts would be delivered in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">relevant channels</a>.</p>
<p>An environment where <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">constructive criticism is encouraged</a> and where blame is not used as a weapon is the only way this strategy can thrive. If you throw around blame then people will not record areas required for improvement and it will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">cause animosity</a>. My view is if you have an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">ultra competitive culture</a> where you <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">pit staff against each other</a> then I cannot help you.</p>
<p>Metrics such as time to fix, number of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">phone calls</a> required, step of document where help was required to name a few. You do not want to make it too complex but make it effective enough so that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">poor documentation practices</a> do not go hidden until the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">individual leaves</a> the organization. Feedback on logic and ease of use from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">junior technicians</a> should always be welcomed; however you should always review the reasons for criticism and ensure they are valid.</p>
<p>An example here is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">junior tech</a> giving a document a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">poor evaluation</a> for say a guide that requires a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor organization</a> to always be created as an organization instead of adding the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">vendor's contact details</a> in a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/consumer routers">router configuration</a> notes area because it takes longer to do and requires more clicks. In this situation, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">junior tech</a> needs to be educated on the correct way of undertaking a particular task.</p>
<p>If a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">junior tech</a> marks a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">document as poor</a> because steps 5 to 11 are missing and the person that wrote it says &ldquo;<em>those steps are common sense so I did not put them in</em>&rdquo; then it is the person who wrote the document that needs some <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">attitude readjustment</a>.</p>
<p>The important thing with the above framework is that nothing is a surprise and once <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff are trained</a> on evaluating each other's documentation then it is like a rising tide lifts all boats type of situation and it becomes one less problem you need to deal with.</p>
<p>If you have left this attitude fester over time then it is time to nip it in the bud. Part of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">changing the culture</a> of your organization is linked to my first point and that is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">charging clients</a> for any and all documentation work.</p>
<p>If you do that first step, then you can legitimately advise your techs that the client is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">paying good money</a> for the documentation to be completed so it needs to be completed to a high standard. By&nbsp; appealing to their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">sense of professionalism</a> in their chosen career, you can quickly stamp out this idea that the task of documentation is an afterthought that will not be a reflection on their professionalism if it is ignored.</p>
<p>Here is a table of real world situations that I have experienced and believe it or not in some cases, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">MSP leadership</a> sided with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">junior technician</a> (Putting Vendor details in configuration notes exclusively)</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well I had intended to do a very superficial article on 30 mistakes MSPs fail at when it comes to documentation and I am 2 points in and over 2000 words so I am going to cut it there.</p>
<p>You can console yourself with the knowledge that the other 28 mistakes that I promised will come in later articles. That is the problem when I get on the topic of MSP documentation, I tend to get a bit overexcited, of course given the subject matter, it is perfectly understandable.</p>
