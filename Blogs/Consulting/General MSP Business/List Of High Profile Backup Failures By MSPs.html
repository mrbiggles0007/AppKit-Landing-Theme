<p>High profile backup failures will be today's hot topic. By collecting a number of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">horror stories</a> relating to instances where organizations have utterly failed in their ability to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">recover</a> from a backup failure, it is my aim to demonstrate that we are no longer out here playing games.</p>
<p>It is time to take whatever <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">backup strategy</a> you are offering to clients and initiate a good going over, a complete top town backwards 360 evaluation if you will. It is my aim to put the fear of god into the readers of the article here and if it creates a situation where even one service provider decides to take action then it will have been worth it and I will achieve my life long goal of being considered a hero.</p>
<p><strong><em>While you are here, Take a look at some of our other </em></strong><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><strong><em>IT Computer Consulting</em></strong></a><strong><em> related articles below that may interest you:</em></strong></p>

<p>The goal of this article is twofold with this collection of nightmare fuel. First it is to facilitate action in the form of taking <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup clients overview">backup and recovery solutions</a> seriously and to encourage a serious <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">review of backup strategy</a>. Secondly to encourage <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">documentation of recovery procedures</a>. It is one thing to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup clients overview">undertake a client's backup</a> but the professionals in our industry fully test and document the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - local overview">recovery procedures</a>.</p>
<p>They also wrap both the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index">backup and recovery solutions</a> up in a little bow in the form of documentation as well as a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">good quality cyber insurance policy</a> because no matter how great you are, there is some crusty old judge out there who is having their Friday golf game being encroached upon by some service provider thinking that they deserve a fair hearing.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">United Airlines Backup Failure - 2015</h2>
<p>It was a crisp yet cloud free morning, just like any other when United suffered what they termed a &ldquo;<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/consumer routers"><em>connectivity issue</em></a>&rdquo; which affected thousands of passengers across the planet. The culprit? A <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">faulty router</a> went rogue and this caused a delay of 90 minutes which of course may not seem like a big deal however for a company the size of United meant millions of dollars lost in canceled flights.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Delta Airlines Backup Failure - 2017</h2>
<p>Not to be outdone and thankfully no planes fell out of the sky on this one either, however a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">configuration problem</a> which is a nice way of saying somebody pressed the wrong button on their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">computer mouse</a>, caused a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/power hardware">power outage</a> at their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">main data center</a>.</p>
<p>As any company would, they whipped out their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup hardware overview">computer backups</a> and as quick as a flash, nothing happened. The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backup strategies overview">company's disaster recovery plan</a> performed as well as a plane with one wing and caused <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup-strategies-index">significant downtime</a>. Someone did not set the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups-index-page-01">backups correctly</a> in the first place and because <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">no test restores occurred</a>. Total cost of this incident was in the order of $25 million. I wonder if the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">IT Support tech responsible</a> was able to talk his way out of that one.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">British Airways Backup Failure - 2018</h2>
<p>This incident demonstrates why it is really worth investing in an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">effective cyber security insurance policy</a> as it shows that even if it is not your fault, you can still be held responsible.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/security incidents overview">data breach</a> was due to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backups - cloud/o365 backup options for msps">third party utility</a> used on the website of the company which redirected visitors to another site that the scoundrels controlled. Approximately 380K <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">customers were impacted</a> over the month this breach occurred.</p>
<p>The criminals went on a no expenses spared shopping spree with the credit card information of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">customers</a> of BA before being detected.</p>
<p>British Airways received a fine in the order of about $350 million. The fine was based on 1.5% of the organization's worldwide turnover. One thing you have to admit here, the governments must be rubbing their hands together every time some sort of breach occurs. They make more money than the criminals.</p>
<p>There really does seem to be a kick them while their down type of behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">TSB Bank Backup Failure - 2018</h2>
<p>This story should make any IT service provider lay awake at night especially if you have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">server migration</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">network infrastructure upgrade</a> scheduled.</p>
<p>They were doing a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">system migration</a> to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">new computer system</a> when all hell broke loose. Every part of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">banking system</a> was impacted by the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">failed migration</a> including <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">phones</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/thin clients">computer terminals</a> in branch locations.</p>
<p>Guess how long it took to recover from this little indiscretion? 8 long months to recover to the point the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network firewalls index">computer network</a> was back to where it was. The fines alone from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation for compliance and regulations">regulatory organizations</a> were in the order of $100 million large ones along with around $60 million in compensation for their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">customers</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps if the bank had <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">outsourced their IT operations</a> and the people undertaking the migration had a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/managing client backups">tested disaster recovery process</a> then this expensive lesson could have been avoided.</p>
<p>Total cost of this oversight was in the order of $700 million.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is but a small selection of high profile backup failures. Companies of the size listed here <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">stand to lose millions</a> of dollars per day if they do not have multiple points of failure and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">fully tested restoration plans</a>. I also show that the biggest winner in any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/communicating backup retention policy">serious backup failure</a> or data breach is the government. For them it is like seeing the <a href="https://roalddahl.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Ticket">Wonka golden ticket</a>. To me that just does not seem right.</p>
<p>There has to be some way to ensure companies adhere to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/chatgpt/top level pages/using chatgpt to create technical documentation for compliance and regulations">rules and regulations</a> prior to the incident occurring although I admit it is a very complex problem with many ins and outs and a lot of what have you&rsquo;s.<br /></p>
