<h2 class="display-6">MSP Profitability Factoids</h2>
<p>While it could be argued that service providers have been around since the 1980s they really only started to go mainstream in the early 2000s which was around the time I <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">began an MSP</a>. Below are some facts that will attempt to surprise and intrigue those interested in the exciting world of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">managed service organizations</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">MSP Global Market Size - 2025</h4>
<p>The global market size for all managed service providers in 2025 is 284 billion dollars.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Projected Market Size - 2030</h4>
<p>700 billion dollars is the expected market size for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">global MSP market</a> in 2030. That is a projected doubling of market size in 7 years. Let's hope we are all still around by 2030.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Cost Savings Using An MSP Brings</h4>
<p>There is an average cost saving of 30% across businesses that use service providers compared to companies that provide their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">own inhouse IT department</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Most Profitable MSP Client Sector</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting statistics on msp hardware purchasing">Manufacturing</a> is the most <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">profitable industry</a> as far as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">MSP clients</a> are concerned, followed closely by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">legal organizations</a> (That is a shock to me!) and then <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">accounting</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Least Profitable MSP Client Sector</h4>
<p>With low margins and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">hyper competitive environments</a> it is no surprise that the retail sector is the least profitable sector. Slightly above retail is hospitality, marketing and then automotive.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Size Of Most Profitable MSP Client</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">size of clients</a> that are the most profitable range from 11 staff up to 50 staff with 51 to 120 being the next most profitable.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Most Profitable Service Offerings</h4>
<p>Fear sells, it seems, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/top level pages/mssp overview">managed security solutions</a> were the most profitable of all services offered by a significant margin followed by a distant second by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/top level pages/backups - cloud overview">cloud backups</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Least Profitable Service Offerings</h4>
<p>Web designers probably should look at entering another profession as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">least most profitable service</a> offering along with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/computer peripherals">managed print providers</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">marketing services</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">MSP Projected Security Market Growth</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/mssps - index">Global security services</a> growth is expected to go from 33 billion in 2025 to 92 billion by 2030 so an expected near 3 fold growth over 7 years.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Average MSP Service Contract Per Month - 2025</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">average MSP contract size</a> across all service providers both large and small is $2500 per month.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Most Popular MSP Billing Method</h4>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">Per user pricing</a> is the most popular billing method at 22% followed by <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">fixed fee subscription</a> at 14% and then per device at 13%.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Number Of MSPs Without Cyber Insurance</h4>
<p>37% of MSPs operate without a cyber insurance policy. Let that sink in! My advice is only do this if you have nothing to lose. Risks are only going one way with service providers.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Number Of MSP Clients Without Cyber Insurance</h4>
<p>93% of non MSP businesses (Your clients) do not have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">cyber insurance policies</a>. I strongly recommend that a requirement of being a client of yours is that they have their own <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/hosting client data backups on your own premises">cyber insurance policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insurance companies are now starting to refuse to do business with service providers because they are seen as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">too high a risk</a>. Forcing clients to obtain their own cyber insurance policy makes you a more attractive client for insurance companies or at the very least they may cover you.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Gross Profit Margin Of MSPs</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">average net profit margin</a> of an MSP ranges from 8% on the low end to 35% on the high end.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The facts relating to MSP profitability above are some of my favorites and could be used by any service provider to focus on areas that are more profitable as well as consider dropping services or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from">business strategies</a> that are not likely to work long term.</p>
