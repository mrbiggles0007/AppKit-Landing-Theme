<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Managed Service Provider specializing in documentation, "</span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimized Documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" understands the importance of maintaining strong relationships with clients. However, in recent years, we have seen a concerning trend in the industry where vendors are reaching out directly to our clients, cutting out MSPs from the equation. In this article, we will explore the problem of vendors contacting clients directly and discuss the companies that engage in this practice. We will also provide strategies to prevent becoming a victim of this practice.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Problem of Vendors Contacting Clients Directly</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The practice of vendors contacting clients directly is a growing concern in the MSP industry. Companies like Kaseya, Fortinet, Dell, and others have been accused of reaching out to MSP clients directly, bypassing the MSPs and attempting to sell their products or services directly to the clients. This puts MSPs in a difficult position, as they risk losing clients to vendors who can offer them better deals or more comprehensive services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, when vendors contact clients directly, it creates confusion and mistrust between the client and the MSP. Clients may wonder why the MSP didn't inform them about the vendor's product or service, or worse, they may believe that the MSP is not providing them with the best solutions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies That Engage in This Practice</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the companies that have been accused of contacting MSP clients directly is Kaseya. In a post on Reddit, an MSP claimed that Kaseya had sabotaged its own security software, forcing the MSP to find an alternative solution. Another company that has been accused of contacting MSP clients directly is Fortinet. In a Reddit post from 2012, an MSP claimed that Fortinet had reached out to its clients directly, offering them a better deal than the MSP could provide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dell is another company that has been accused of reaching out to MSP clients directly. In a Reddit post from 2019, an MSP warned others that Dell had brought in a third-party company to sell directly to its clients, without the MSP's knowledge. These are just a few examples of the companies that engage in this practice, and there are likely more out there.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategies to Prevent Becoming a Victim</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can MSPs do to prevent vendors from contacting their clients directly? One strategy is to have a solid client relationship. MSPs should make an effort to build strong relationships with their clients and establish themselves as trusted advisors. This can help to prevent clients from being swayed by vendors who may offer them better deals or more comprehensive services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another strategy is to have a well-thought-out </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Poor documentation can lead to confusion and mistrust between MSPs and their clients, making it easier for vendors to swoop in and take over. MSPs should invest in a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Glue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep track of client information, projects, and support desk functions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, MSPs should keep an eye out for vendors who may be contacting their clients directly. If a client mentions a vendor's product or service, MSPs should be proactive in addressing the issue and offering their own solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dummy Email Address</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One potential strategy for preventing vendors from contacting clients directly is to create a dummy email account that is controlled by the MSP and provide this email address to the vendors. The idea behind this strategy is to give the vendors a way to contact the MSP directly without having access to the MSP's client contact information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here's how this strategy could work:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a dummy email account - The first step is to create a new email account that will be used solely for vendor communications. This email account should be controlled by the MSP and not associated with any individual client. It's important to choose an email address that is professional and easy to remember.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share the email address with vendors - Once the email account has been created, the MSP should share this email address with all vendors who may need to contact them. This could include vendors who are currently working with the MSP, as well as potential new vendors who may be interested in partnering with the MSP.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train staff on how to use the email account - It's important to ensure that all staff members who may be involved in vendor communications are trained on how to use the dummy email account. This includes knowing how to access the account, how to respond to vendor emails, and what types of information should be shared through this account.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor the email account regularly - The MSP should make sure to monitor the dummy email account regularly to ensure that all vendor communications are being handled appropriately. This includes responding to emails in a timely manner, forwarding relevant information to the appropriate staff members, and flagging any suspicious or inappropriate communications.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By implementing this strategy, the MSP can maintain control over their client contact information and prevent vendors from contacting clients directly. This can help to build trust with clients and ensure that the MSP is providing the best possible service. However, it's important to note that this strategy may not be foolproof and other measures may need to be taken to prevent vendors from contacting clients directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another strategy that can be used to prevent vendors from contacting clients directly is by giving them a phone number that the MSP controls. This phone number can be used as a buffer between the vendor and the client. Here's how it can work:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a new phone number that will be used exclusively for vendor communications. This number can be a virtual number that is forwarded to the MSP's main phone line or a dedicated phone line that is set up specifically for this purpose.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide the new phone number to vendors as the primary point of contact for all communications related to the client. This can be done in writing or verbally, but it's important to emphasize that the vendor should not contact the client directly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train the staff who will be answering the phone on how to handle vendor calls. They should be instructed to identify themselves as representatives of the MSP and to take a message from the vendor. If the vendor is calling about an urgent issue, the staff should follow the MSP's established procedures for escalation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor the phone line regularly to ensure that vendors are following the protocol. If a vendor contacts the client directly, it's important to follow up with them immediately and remind them of the agreed-upon protocol.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, using a phone number controlled by the MSP can be an effective way to prevent vendors from contacting clients directly. It provides a layer of protection for the client and allows the MSP to maintain control over the relationship with the vendor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Importance of Documentation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, having a well-thought-out </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is essential for MSPs. Poor documentation can lead to lost time, lost revenue, and lost clients. MSPs should invest in a </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Glue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep track of client information, projects, and support desk functions. With a comprehensive </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, MSPs can provide better service to their clients, leading to increased client retention and revenue.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, it is clear that the issue of vendors directly contacting clients is a growing problem in the </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">managed service provider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry. While it can be challenging to prevent vendors from attempting to reach out to clients, there are steps that MSPs can take to minimize the likelihood of this happening. These include establishing clear boundaries with vendors, implementing effective </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and setting up communication channels that are controlled by the MSP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the use of dummy email accounts and phone numbers that are controlled by the MSP can be an effective way to prevent vendors from contacting clients directly. By implementing these strategies and being vigilant about vendor interactions, MSPs can better protect their clients and their business interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important to note that having a well-planned and organized </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be instrumental in preventing vendors from reaching out to clients directly. By ensuring that all client information is stored securely and accessible only by authorized personnel, MSPs can better control the flow of information and minimize the risk of vendors attempting to circumvent them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, it is up to MSPs to be proactive in preventing vendors from contacting clients directly. By staying informed about industry trends, being vigilant about vendor interactions, and implementing effective </span><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, MSPs can better protect their clients and their business interests in the long run.</span></p>
