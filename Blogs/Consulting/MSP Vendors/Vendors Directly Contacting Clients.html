<p>Vendor&rsquo;s directly contacting clients will be the infuriating topic of today's article. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">Vendor&rsquo;s betray us</a> in a number of ways however nothing has quite the sting in its tail as when they make contact directly with our clients in an attempt to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">cut us out</a> especially when often, we <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">helped the vendor</a> to get where they are today and they would not even know about the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client</a> had it not been for us.</p>

<div data-linkz-ai-container>
<h2 class="display-6">Vendors Stealing Our Clients</h2>
<p>Vendor&rsquo;s steal our clients in a number of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">different ways</a> and it depends on the age of and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">size of the vendor</a> as to how blatant they are with their actions.</p>
<p>While I understand there is not much we can do about this behavior as it is so ingrained, imagine for a moment that as an MSP you undertook a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">brief partnership</a> with another MSP to complete a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">network replacement project</a> and completed it successfully.</p>
<p>Because the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/diagrams/general diagram topics/project diagram tool">project was run</a> by the other MSP, you needed access to their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">internal system</a> including their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">full client list</a>. Now imagine secretly downloading their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">client list</a> and having your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/application purchase and cloud-based subscription fees">sales team</a> start contacting every client on that list in an attempt to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">poach their clients</a>?</p>
<p>Is that a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">morally wrong practice</a> and not just about the lowest of the low when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/cancelling kaseya spanning backup">betraying someone</a> that trusted you? Well the behavior is exactly the same and is just as reprehensible.</p>
<p>Still it is a bit pointless getting angry over being bent over and rogered without any remedy. I have a few tips I have picked up over the years that should help MSPs struggling to prevent vendors who are directly contacting your customers.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Reactionary Methods - Theft Of Clients</h2>
<p>Below are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">number of strategies</a> that you can attempt once the situation of client theft occurs. I believe the first step of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">contacting the vendor</a> is universal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of the situation, the very first step should always be to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">contact your vendor</a> and ideally your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">first point of contact</a> before considering any further action or even getting upset about it because there can often be perfectly innocent reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something I have learnt in business over many years is not to go off half-cocked and to always give people the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">benefit of the doubt</a> until it can be proven otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Contact Vendor - First Course Of Action</h3>
<p>Below are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps still conduct onsite visits">preventative measures</a> however this action to me is the most obvious after an incident of vendors directly trying to pilfer your clients. Before going scorched earth or relying on medieval techniques to address this, the first and best course of action is to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp vendors-index">contact your vendor</a> and ask them politely to stop.</p>
<p>There is a chance that your vendor may have gotten the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">details of your client</a> legitimately from a number of legitimate means from trade fairs, your client entering a competition to straight up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">cold calling</a>. Once they know it is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client of yours</a> then there is a small chance the vendor will back off especially if they are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">smaller vendor</a>.</p>
<p>In my experience, the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">large vendors</a> will just lie to you, they legitimately have zero shame and will continue trying to steal your client regardless and so this strategy is unlikely to work for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still this is the right strategy to take because we need to establish if the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">issue is malicious</a> or not.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Cease And Desist Letter</h3>
<p>If you are certain that the vendor has obtained the clients details from the details you have given them then you could try sending a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">cease and desist letter</a> demanding that they cease contact. If you have proof the vendor used information you provided to them to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/msp - dealing with difficult clients">contact the client</a> then include that as well as instances where they have been asked to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/firing clients">stop making contact</a> ideally by both you and the client.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">I am not a lawyer</a>, in fact I cross the road if I see a courthouse so I would definitely double check this with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">someone legally qualified</a>. The state you live in is likely to impact how you do this.</p>
<p>I have never actually tried this and I am suspicious as to if the vendor would probably use it as toilet paper but I felt I should mention it anyway.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Take Vendor To Court</h3>
<p>Let's face it unless you are a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">large MSP</a> and there is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">significant amounts of money</a> involved then this is probably not going to be worth taking it this far.</p>
<p>I have seen organizations I have worked for do this and actually come out on top but in those cases there was <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">clear evidence</a> that the vendor had used the information the MSP had <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/best effort and msp liability">given in confidence</a> to the vendor in the process.</p>
<p>I am unsure if <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/how liable are your clients for a data breach">cybersecurity insurance</a> would cover the process of legal action in this scenario and so it could be a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">significant financial overhead</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Preventative Methods - Stealing MSP Clients</h2>
<p>Below are the strategies that I put in place while <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">running my own MSP</a> that discouraged the poaching of clients from vendors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My view these days is to accept that all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">major vendors</a> will do everything in their power to move your clients over to their clients and cut you out of the relationship. They say we should <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/it-consulting-services">not take offense</a> and that it is just business however it does upset me.</p>
<p>It annoys me that I have to put <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">countermeasures in place</a> to subvert their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">lack of integrity</a> as I am sure many of you are, especially when most of us have watched these vendors grow from nearly nothing and would not be where they are today <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">without our help</a> over the years.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Train Clients To Ignore Direct Sales Calls</h3>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">Ignoring direct sales calls</a> is actually a very <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of most damaging ransomware attacks involving msps">valid countermeasure</a> in reducing the risks when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">targeted phishing</a> also known as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">spear phishing</a> along with other <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security-index-page-01">security weaknesses</a> involving the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">human element</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">Educate your clients</a> during the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/onboarding/onboarding-tasks">onboarding process</a> that any and all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">direct sales communication</a> regardless as to if it is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">phone based</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">email based</a> is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/security/security applications - index">serious security risk</a> and that any examples should be passed on to you or ignored.</p>
<p>Clients are happy with this because it is another responsibility they do not want to have to deal with and one they have not asked for.</p>
<p>This can help get around the more <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp vendors overview">sophisticated vendors</a> who force you to pass on correct client details allowing them to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">contact them directly</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Train Clients To Pass On All IT Related Calls</h3>
<p>This relates to the above however if you can <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">educate your clients</a> to pass on any and all <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/voice over ip hardware index">IT related phone calls</a> including <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">sales calls</a> without question then this can solve the issue where the interloper has specific information such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">account numbers</a> and specific names of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">decision makers</a>.</p>
<p>You really want to avoid the situation where the vendor of low moral fiber has managed to get in front of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">relevant decision maker</a> where they can pitch the usual story of being able to offer the same thing for less money.</p>
<p>This is where the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp disaster recovery attempts that failed">serious risk occurs</a> and I mean if they are offering a like for like on a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">particular product</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp open source apps overview">software licensing</a> or <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/servers">server hardware</a> then it is not too damaging because most of the time, it only makes up part of the project.</p>
<p>The problems that tend to cause the most headaches in my experience is when they are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">so incompetent</a> that they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">offer a cheaper price</a> only for you to find out that what they are offering is different to what you have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">quoted</a>.</p>
<p>This causes so many headaches because it forces you to go through both <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">quotes</a> with a fine tooth comb and even then they seem to be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp ai adoption that artificial intelligence delivered">pretty proficient</a> at hiding the parts of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">their offer</a> that are either deficient or completely missing. In this scenario, it matters little if they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">completely lied</a> about their quote, because if you manage the project, you will <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">bear the responsibility</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Make Features Contingent Upon Total Package</h3>
<p>So the revolting vendor with zero morals has managed to get in front of one of your clients <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">primary decision maker</a> and have successfully convinced them that there is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">significant discount</a> by going direct and cutting out the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blog">friendly middle man</a> (you)</p>
<p>This is where having appropriately drawn up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">legally binding MSP agreements</a> that clearly list what forms part of the agreement is your first and best line of defense. Part of having a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/10 tips to starting your own msp">good agreement</a> is educating your client on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">correct process and procedure</a> when it comes to anything <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">IT related</a> and that includes <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">all products</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">services purchased</a> through you that makes up the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">MSP agreement</a>.</p>
<p>As an example part of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">your agreement</a> could be the purchase and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">management of workstations</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/workstations index">workstation warranty management</a>. It needs to be made clear at the final <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">sales meeting</a> where they are about to sign up, the components such as this, make up the final <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">monthly agreement price</a>.</p>
<p>I used to have a list of around 10 items that would vary from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/voice over ip hardware">VOIP licensing</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network switch">networking equipment</a> to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/business notebooks &amp; laptops">business notebooks</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/mobile phones for business">cell phones</a>.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Alternate Price Clearly In MSP Agreement</h3>
<p>So you have listed all of the components that make up the price of your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">monthly MSP agreement</a> which is great but those alone do not really create a situation to prevent clients from bypassing you and going straight to the vendor.</p>
<p>The alternate <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">agreement price</a> however will. Because you have priced the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">total package</a> based on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">individual parts</a>, it stands to reason that like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga">game of jenga</a>, if someone starts pulling individual components away from the total agreement, well, it could completely <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">destroy the profitability</a> of the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/vertical apps overview">total package</a> and let's face it often does.</p>
<p>This is where an alternative <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">cumulatively increasing price</a> needs to be highlighted in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-services">any MSP agreement</a> and it needs to be put in front of the client, explained and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">signed separately</a> to the agreement itself.</p>
<p>At that point in time, the client is not likely going to be armed with the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">separate prices</a> of each component that makes up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">your service agreement</a> and so my advice is to make it simple, is ideally, find the component that would have the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">largest impact</a> on your agreement if the client cuts you out and work out the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">true cost</a> of losing that part of the agreement and apply it to every single other component.</p>
<p>So for example you figure out that losing the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">Meraki subscription</a> after <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/network firewalls index">Meraki</a> have gone direct to your client and cut you out will be in the order of $280 <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">per month profit</a>. Now add $100 to that amount. The extra $100 is so that the discount offered by the vendor will always be less favorable than the increased <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">service agreement cost</a>.</p>
<p>Being that $280 per month is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">worst case scenario</a>, apply the calculated $380 to all components that are at risk of being poached by greedy vendors and ensure the client understands that it is a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">cumulative amount</a>.</p>
<p>This means if 2 IT vendors successfully convince your client to go direct then the increase in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">monthly service agreement</a> will be $760 per month.</p>
<p>Now the idea here is that the increase in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">monthly service agreement</a> cost will always eclipse any savings they would have obtained by cutting you out.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Labor Costs Excluded From Changes To The Agreement</h3>
<p>The idea with all of these inclusions in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">service agreement</a> is to make it as painful as possible for the vendor to steal your clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Say the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/clients/ignoring post ransomware insurance recommendations">worst case scenario</a> happens and the vendor has done a real number on your client <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">promising the world</a> and it just so happens you were away for a week when it happened and the client went ahead with the deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First mistake was leaving without having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation">appropriate procedures in place</a> for another <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff member</a> to make these decisions in your absence. This is where a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">documentation platform</a> such as <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">Hudu</a> would allow you to create an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">effective standard operating procedure</a> on who would be <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">delegated this task</a> in your absence. Ah well, next time perhaps!</p>
<p>So you get back from that conference on emerging trends in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/rugged computers">rugged notebook technology</a> and find that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/hpe greenlake vs dell apex">Dell</a> is now managing your clients <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/enterprise drives purchased from amazon - warning">hardware warranties</a> for their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/workstations index">desktops</a> and you are completely <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business">cut out of the arrangement</a>.</p>
<p>You refer the client to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">original clause</a> where their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">service agreement</a> will now have to increase by another $380 per month. This hopefully means the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">total cost</a> to the client is now higher than when you managed this component.</p>
<p>On top of that, this decision by the client has caused you the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">most damaging thing</a> that can happen for an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">MSP profit wise</a>, it has <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">caused an exception</a>. Of your 70 clients, they are the only ones that now have their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/workstations">desktop warranties</a> purchased and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/wd gold enterprise vs dell poweredge">managed through Dell</a>.</p>
<p>The reality of this is it is going to require newly written <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/standard-operating-procedures">knowledge base articles</a> written for your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">help desk staff</a> so they are aware of the steps to take when <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/wd gold enterprise vs dell poweredge">warranties expire</a> or when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/thin clients">new thin client</a> is purchased, it is going to cause <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">ongoing extra labor</a> because everytime an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">exception like this</a> occurs, it is going to take a toll because it will always <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/expensive documentation failures in msps">cause confusion</a> every time the issue of certain warranties comes up for this client.</p>
<p>You need to<a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msp income &amp; where it comes from"> bill for this time</a> because it goes <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">outside of the agreement</a>. This also needs to be clearly stated in the MSP agreement and explained to the client in detail and have them <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">signed separately</a>. This is so when these <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">unfortunate events</a> do occur, the client does not feel tricked by the whole situation.</p>
<p>Again, this is not a strategy designed to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">hurt the client</a>, it is designed to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">persuade the client</a> not to make decisions that <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">negatively affect profit margins</a> that your agreements bring in. Hopefully an event like this only occurs once and the client learns that the MSP agreement is something everyone needs to respect for it to work.</p>
<h4 class="display-4">Alter Flow Of Communications</h3>
<p>It is harder to do these days because vendors force us to hand over so much <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">client information</a> and it takes little effort for the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">sales team</a> of a sneaky vendor to double check the information online, however I have found that giving <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">alternate communications</a> to the vendor is the best course of action.</p>
<p>Always give the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">primary email address</a> as an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">email address</a> you control. With the clients permission, have <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/msp general applications-index-page">emails</a> that originate from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">certain domains</a> or have certain keywords within forwarded to an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/msp general applications overview">email address</a> that you control.</p>
<p>This ensures that a significant number of attempts by vendors to directly contact your client will fail.</p>
<p>Attempt to have a number advertised as the MSP you control and that is likely the most attractive to shifty vendors <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps that use crm tools &amp; the benefits compared to those that do not">looking to contact</a> your clients.</p>
<p>If you can work with the client to put in place an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">automated incoming answering system</a> that diverts sales calls to a number you control. You could even <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">sell</a> this type of thing as a service that you provide, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking antivirus statistics for msps">shielding clients</a> from <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/voice over ip hardware index">cold calls</a>.</p>
<p>Couple this with offering free training to the receptionists so that they know the type of questions to answer to prevent even the sneakiest vendor sales people from getting through to anyone but the MSP and you have a near bullet proof system for preventing the situation where you need to fall back on your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">service agreement</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Preventing Vendors Stealing Clients - Downside</h2>
<p>There is one downside that can come from implementing a legally useful <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">service agreement</a> and that is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">MSP clients</a> could hold it against you when <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about msps">renewal time</a> comes around and you might <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/common reasons msp clients leave">lose a client</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My view is it is better to lose an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">unprofitable client</a> that does not respect the agreement than to hold onto them by catering to their whim. It paves the way for a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/msp - clients wanting discounts">profitable MSP client</a> that understands the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">contractual obligations</a> they are under and understands the ramifications of breaking them.</p>
<p>The way to avoid this occurring is to really make a big deal at sign on about the service agreement being a sum of its parts and that modifying any of them during the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp legal overview">agreement period</a> will require adjustments so that your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp finance overview">profit margin is maintained</a>.</p>
<p>Most clients will never have an issue with this and I certainly never had issues with this even during the few times changes were required.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pain is often the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/top reasons msps are moving to halo psa">best persuader</a> when it comes avoiding actions that cause it. I strongly advise to have additions to your agreement that are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal/msp specific attorneys">legally binding</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States">your state</a> as well as the state the client belongs to that ensure that you are not disadvantaged if a vendor successfully contacts your client and cuts you out of the relationship.</p>
<p>Of course this needs to be backed up by appropriate education regarding the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp legal-index">clauses</a> that relate to this as well as investing in some <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">training for clients staff</a> so that they know how to handle any high risk sales calls that originate from your vendor.</p>
