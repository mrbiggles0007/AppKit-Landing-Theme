<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let's define what we mean by cables and adapters. Cables are cords or wires that transmit data or power between devices. Adapters, on the other hand, are devices that convert one type of connection to another, enabling compatibility between devices that may not have the same ports or connectors. For example, a USB-C to HDMI adapter would allow you to connect a USB-C device to an HDMI display.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of cables and adapters in modern technology cannot be overstated. As devices become smaller and more portable, they often sacrifice ports and connectors for sleeker designs. This means that users may need to rely on adapters to connect their devices to external displays, keyboards, and other peripherals. Additionally, the rise of wireless technology has not eliminated the need for cables entirely, as wired connections can still offer faster data transfer speeds and more reliable connections than wireless alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several types of cables and adapters commonly used in North America.
