			<h1 class="display-6">Completion Of Documentation Upgrade Project</h1>
            <p class="intro">All major milestones have been completed - Can we now just expect our internal staff to take over?</p> 
<p>It has been our repeated experience over the years that no matter how well <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">internal support staff</a> are <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp employees overview">trained</a>, if there is not some form of oversight on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">agreed to standards</a>, those standards quickly fall apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an example, think about the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">number of passwords</a> each week that your organization creates. How many months do you think it will take before there is a substantial number that no longer adhere to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">implemented standards</a> for naming them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We set up <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">password names</a> so that the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/password management apps-index">global password list</a> can be used in the most effective and granular way. At project completion as an example, every single <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">AD Domain Admin password</a> across every single <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client</a> can be seen in a list just by typing "01 D" in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">global password</a> search column.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Leaving Documentation Maintenance To Internal Staff?</h2>
<p>Take a moment to consider how much time would be wasted if your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/is your msp toxic for employees">new staff</a> are trained to find the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/backups/backup hardware/best ideas for large local file storage with azuread">domain admin password</a> this way and then in a short amount of time 5% of those names are now created using a random method of naming?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It causes substantial back and forth between <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff members</a> who cannot find an important piece of information that can add up to hours all because it was 20 seconds faster to come up with a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">random naming convention</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Documentation Maintenance Agreement The Solution?</h2>
<p>With our <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">system</a> and again keeping it restricted to passwords for this example, we have 4 or 5 ways to methodically <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">access passwords</a> either from being located within the correct <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/apps/top level pages/password management apps overview">password folder</a>, using a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">flexible asset</a> for fast access to common passwords or the name itself.</p>
<p>By adhering to a strict password naming convention, your organization can now utilize the global tab in ITGlue (which 90% of organizations never use).&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Decent Into Documentation Anarchy</h2>
<p>Staff tend to in almost all cases minimize the damage caused when they ignore naming standards and it <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">costs your organization</a> in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking facts about msp income">wasted hours</a>. I have personally seen well executed documentation remediation projects completely fall apart within 6 months if staff are not motivated to adhere to standards.</p>
<p>If you allow your documentation standards to be subject to the whims of your technical staff and do not put it as a high priority then no documentation remediation project in the world is going to help your organization.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">3rd Party Documentation Maintenance</h2>
<p>By continuing to engage us after the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">project completion</a> has occurred, we use a number of methods to effectively <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">monitor recorded entries</a> into your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">documentation application</a>. Depending on how your organization operates this can be considered as an ongoing cost or there may be a goal of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">internal staff</a> taking over the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">maintenance completely</a>.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to be the bad guy so the solution is to pay us to be the bad guy. We will both rectify and instill a culture within your organization that ensures the investment put into any documentation remediation project sees a return over the long term.</p>
<p>The cost to maintain a well structured documentation framework is so much cheaper than mopping up a slow rolling disaster.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Why Internal Staff Benefit From External Oversight</h2>
<p>There is a possibility that when looking at any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">individual record</a> with regards to documentation that staff could have a point, it could be argued that on any one particular record the way they have completed it is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">technically better</a>.</p>
<p>The issue is that they get called away to do a project and do not look at the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">documentation system</a> again for another 6 months or they <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">leave for a position</a> at another company and then the next person enters it their way &amp; the same discussion on how their way is better than the old way is had before they half finish a document and the situation repeats itself over and over year after year until you do not have a standard and nobody is able to find anything.</p>
<p>It is better to have an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">average standard</a> that is agreed to by everyone and then have everyone stick to it than to continually change things because the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">new lead tech</a> believes there is a better way. It is important to reinforce that if it really is a better way then we need to take into account that every single document needs to be retroactively updated with this new standard otherwise there is <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/offboarding/offboarding-tasks">no longer any standard</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">How We Can Help</h2>
<p>Our business has spent the last 10 years working only on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">improving the documentation framework</a> that MSPs use within their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">documentation platform</a>. We have seen what works, what does not work &amp; have a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">refined documentation method</a> of how we recommend setting the various components up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes a business comes along that does things so radically different that we either need to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/general msp business overview">modify our method</a> for them in some areas or if we feel they are too far outside our area of expertise then we will not take on the project. An example of this would be an MSP that only maintains the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/top level pages/network firewalls">network infrastructure</a> of clients. In a case like that, investing time on <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/Blogs/Hardware/TOP LEVEL PAGES/Workstations">workstation or endpoint configurations</a> is a waste of time where for most MSPs, it is a significant component to get right.</p>
<p>We are however able to help the majority of MSPs above 10 staff. Think of the bell curve or 80/20 rule, our best results are obtained for the MSP that provides a standard suite of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">documentation services</a> to a MSP that has the standard number of clients for their given size.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Documentation Maintenance Agreement Requirements</h2>
<p>We <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance-index">price the maintenance</a> along similar lines to an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">MSP agreement</a>. Once we have obtained signoff on the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation remediation project</a> then your organization has the option to engage us in maintaining any area where we have brought it up to an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp clients overview">agreed upon standard</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">documentation maintenance agreement</a> is offered to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients/5 tips for improving client technical competence">existing clients</a> who have undertaken the full <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">documentation remediation project</a> and who have committed to undertaking all required steps.</p>
<p>This is not open to any systems that have not been brought up to the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/services">required standard</a>. Think of it along similar lines to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">managed services agreement</a> and how you would handle a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp clients">client site</a> that has devices well <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">outside the warranty period</a> where your organization has not had the opportunity to bring it up to the minimum standard.</p>
<p><br />These <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/minimum price point for your msp">prices are guides</a>. We attempt to keep these amounts as fair as possible for your business. If your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">internal staff</a> are able to carry most of the load without guidance and we are not logging as many hours as what is expected, then we will adjust this amount to reflect. If your company has factors that increase the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp finance/charging an offboarding fee">expected labor expended</a> then we will need to review the amount upwards.</p>
