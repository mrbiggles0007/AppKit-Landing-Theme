<p>Having spent over 25 years in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">Managed Services Provider (MSP) industry</a>, I have seen the common issues that arise when it comes to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">documentation framework</a> blueprints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems encountered is that MSPs often gradually grow their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">current documentation systems</a> over sometimes decades. This means that there is often no clear and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">consistent documentation structure</a> in place, making it difficult for <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">technical staff</a> to find relevant information.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">Lack Of Consistency Over Time</h2>
<p>The biggest failure of an <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/5 tips on documentation in it small business support">MSP's documentation system</a> is the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">lack of consistency over time</a>. <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/optimizing documentation can improve profit margins">Maintaining documentation internally</a> always leads to a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/surprising msp documentation strategy failures">subpar documentation framework</a> due to the problem of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/10 tips on sop's (standard operating procedures)">maintaining consistency</a> over a long time frame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/top level pages/msp documentation overview">poorly functioning documentation</a> system can cost MSPs thousands of dollars in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">lost productivity</a>, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/27 intriguing facts about managed service providers">missed opportunities</a>, and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">decreased customer satisfaction</a>.The true cost of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">bad documentation</a> is estimated to be $31,000 per <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">employee per year</a>.</p>
<p>Can you think of a single other factor in your <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">managed services business</a> that could come anywhere near either that level of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/interesting reasons most msps fail">efficiency loss</a> or that level of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">potential for improvement</a>?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">economies of scale</a> when it comes to implementing a consistent and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-maintenance">reliable documentation framework</a> are staggering.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Consistency Over Time</h2>
<p>Maintaining a functioning set of <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/increasing the professionalism of your msp">processes and procedures</a> for keeping a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">documentation system</a> at its best with <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">internal staff</a> is near impossible due to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">key staff</a> joining and leaving over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">new hire</a>, no matter how <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/consulting-index-page-01">competent</a> they may be, will negatively impact the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">document system</a> because it erodes the consistency which is the single most important part of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/flexible-asset-automation">functional documentation system</a>. This can result in confusion, <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/little known facts about msp profitability">wasted time</a>, and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">decreased productivity</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Obsolete Documentation</h2>
<p>Ignoring <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/duplication-elimination">obsolete information</a> instead of deleting it causes massive time waste as staff need to work through <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for choosing a documentation platform">pointless information</a> in an attempt to find <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 tips for creating effective client documentation">relevant information</a>. This can result in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/what makes a technician-engineer consider leaving">staff spending hours</a> on a task that should only take minutes, leading to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">decreased productivity</a> and <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">increased frustration</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Key Staff Members Leaving</h2>
<p>Furthermore, when a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">staff member leaves</a>, any <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/hardware/hardware-index-page-01">systems</a> they put in place are often instantly forgotten as the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">new key staff member</a> begins and who in some cases wants to put their own stamp on their new position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can lead to confusion among <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees/dealing with talented technicians">remaining staff</a> who now have to endure <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp documentation/5 differences between an sop and a kb">changing processes</a> that may well be more logical and save more time than the decisions the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking reasons msp techs quit">new key technician</a> has decided to put in place.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">True Cost of Poor Documentation</h2>
<p>The cost of a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/documentation-remediation">poorly functioning documentation system</a> goes beyond just <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/msps &amp; dealing with burnout">lost productivity</a>. It can also impact <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking statistics about msp client disatisfaction">customer satisfaction</a> and ultimately lead to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/shocking list of ways msp vendors betray us">lost business</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A survey by Genebra Quality found that 70% of companies have lost business due to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/general msp business/30 unique facts on how msps fail with documentation management">poor document management</a>. Additionally, Centriworks found that companies spend an average of $20 in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">labor</a> to file a document, $120 in <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/msp employees-index">labor</a> to find a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">misfiled document</a>, and $220 in labor to reproduce a <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/blogs/consulting/internal documentation management - biggest msp mistake">lost document</a>.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">The Solution</h2>
<p>With over a decade of experience dedicated to <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/remediation-pricing">improving IT Service documentation</a> using <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/itglue-to-hudu-migration">IT Glue</a> over 15 different organizations as well as having <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">started my own MSP</a> in 2004, I have the knowledge and expertise to help MSPs overcome their <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/keys/maintenance-pricing">documentation challenges</a>.&nbsp;</p>
