<p>Having spent over 25 years in the <a href="https://optimizeddocs.com/about">Managed Services Provider (MSP) industry</a>, I have seen the common issues that arise when it comes to documentation systems. One of the biggest problems I have encountered is that MSPs often gradually grow their current documentation systems over sometimes decades. This means that there is often no clear and consistent structure in place, making it difficult for staff to find relevant information.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Lack Of Consistency Over Time</h2>
<p>The biggest failure of an MSP's documentation system is the lack of consistency over time. Maintaining documentation internally always leads to a subpar documentation framework due to the problem of maintaining consistency over a long time frame. A poorly functioning documentation system can cost MSPs thousands of dollars in lost productivity, missed opportunities, and decreased customer satisfaction.The true cost of bad documentation is estimated to be $31,000 per employee per year.</p>
<p>Can you think of a single other factor in your managed services business that could come anywhere near either that level of efficiency loss or that level of potential for improvement?</p>
<p>The economies of scale when it comes to implementing a consistent and reliable documentation framework are staggering.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Consistency Over Time</h2>
<p>Maintaining a functioning set of processes and procedures for keeping a documentation system at its best with internal staff is near impossible due to key staff joining and leaving over time. Each new hire, no matter how competent they may be, will negatively impact the documentation system because it erodes the consistency which is the single most important part of a functional documentation system. This can result in confusion, wasted time, and decreased productivity.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Obsolete Documentation</h2>
<p>Ignoring obsolete information instead of deleting it causes massive time waste as staff need to work through pointless information in an attempt to find relevant information. This can result in staff spending hours on a task that should only take minutes, leading to decreased productivity and increased frustration.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">Key Staff Members Leaving</h2>
<p>Furthermore, when a staff member leaves, any systems they put in place are often instantly forgotten as the new key staff member begins and who in some cases wants to put their own stamp on their new position. This can lead to confusion among remaining staff who now have to endure changing processes that may well be more logical and save more time than the decisions the new key staff member has decided to put in place.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">True Cost of Poor Documentation</h2>
<p>The cost of a poorly functioning documentation system goes beyond just lost productivity. It can also impact customer satisfaction and ultimately lead to lost business. A survey by Genebra Quality found that 70% of companies have lost business due to poor document management. Additionally, Centriworks found that companies spend an average of $20 in labor to file a document, $120 in labor to find a misfiled document, and $220 in labor to reproduce a lost document.</p>
<h2 class="display-6">The Solution</h2>
